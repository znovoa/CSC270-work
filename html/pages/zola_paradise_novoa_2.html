			<div class="cts_corpus"><div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.1</span><span class="cts_passage">CHAPTER III.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Every Saturday, between four and six, Madame Desforges offered a cup of tea and a few cakes to those friends who were kind enough to visit her. She occupied the third floor of a house at the corner of the Rue de Rivoli and the Rue d'Alger; and the windows of both drawing-rooms overlooked the Tuileries Gardens. This Saturday, just as a footman was about to introduce him into the principal drawing-room, Mouret perceived from the anteroom, through an open door, Madame Desforges, who was crossing the little drawing-room. She stopped on seeing him, and he went in that way, bowing to her with a ceremonious air. But when the footman had closed the door, he quickly seized the young woman's hand, and tenderly kissed it.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.3</span><span class="cts_passage">“Take care, I have company!” she said, in a low voice, glancing towards the door of the larger room. “I've just been to fetch this fan to show them,” and she playfully tapped him on the face with the tip of the fan. She was dark, rather stout, with big jealous eyes.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.4</span><span class="cts_passage">But he still held her hand and asked: “Will he come?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.5</span><span class="cts_passage">“Certainly,” replied she. “I have his promise.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.6</span><span class="cts_passage">Both of them referred to Baron Hartmann, director of the Credit Immobilier. Madame Desforges, daughter of a Councillor of State, was the widow of a stock-broker, who had left her a fortune, denied by some, exaggerated by others. Even during her husband's lifetime people said she had shown herself grateful towards Baron Hartmann, whose financial tips had proved very useful to them; and later on, after her husband's death, the acquaintance had probably continued, but always discreetly, without imprudence or display; for she never courted notoriety in any way, and was received everywhere in the upper-middle classes amongst whom she was born. Even at this time, when the passion of the banker, a sceptical, crafty man, had subsided into a simple paternal affection, if she permitted herself certain lovers whom he tolerated, she displayed in these treasons of the heart such a delicate reserve and tact, a knowledge of the world so adroitly applied, that appearances were saved, and no one would have ventured to openly express any doubt as to her conduct Having met Mouret at a mutual friend's, she had at first detested him; but she had yielded to him later on, as if carried away by the violent love with which he attacked her, and since he had commenced to approach Baron Hartmann through her, she had gradually got to love him with a real profound tenderness, adoring him with the violence of a woman already thirty-five, although only acknowledging twenty-nine, and in despair at feeling him younger than herself, trembling lest she should lose him.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“Does he know about it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, you'll explain the affair to him yourself,” she replied.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.9</span><span class="cts_passage">She looked at him, thinking that he couldn't know anything or he would not employ her in this way with the baron, affecting to consider him simply as an old friend of hers. But he still held her hand, he called her his good Henriette, and she felt her heart melting. Silently she presented her lips, pressed them to his, then whispered: “Oh, they're waiting for me. Come in behind me.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.10</span><span class="cts_passage">They could hear voices issuing from the principal drawingroom, deadened by the heavy curtains. She pushed the door, leaving its two folds open, and handed the fan to one of the four ladies who were seated in the middle of the room.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“There it is,” said she; “I didn't know exactly where it was. My maid would never have found it.” And she added in her cheerful way: “Come in, Monsieur Mouret, come through the little drawing-room; it will be less solemn.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.12</span><span class="cts_passage">Mouret bowed to the ladies whom he knew. The drawingroom, with its flowered brocatel Louis XVI. furniture, gilded bronzes and large green plants, had a tender feminine air, notwithstanding the height of the ceiling; and through the two windows could be seen the chestnut trees in the Tuileries Gardens, their leaves blowing about in the October wind.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“But it isn't at all bad, this Chantilly!” exclaimed Madame Bourdelais, who had taken the fan.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.14</span><span class="cts_passage">She was a short fair woman of thirty, with a delicate nose and sparkling eyes, an old school-fellow of Henriette's, and who had married a chief clerk in the Treasury. Of an old middle-class family, she managed her household and three children with a rare activity and good grace, and an exquisite knowledge of practical life.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“And you paid twenty-five francs for it?” resumed she, examining each mesh of the lace. “At Luc, I think you said, to a country woman? No, it isn't dear; but you had to get it mounted, hadn't you?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“Of course,” replied Madame Desforges. “The mounting cost me two hundred francs.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.17</span><span class="cts_passage">Madame Bourdelais began to laugh. And that was what Henriette called a bargain! Two hundred francs for a plain ivory mount, with a monogram! And that for a simple piece of Chantilly, over which she had saved five francs, perhaps. Similar fans could be had ready, mounted for a hundred and twenty francs, and she named a shop in the Rue Poissonnière.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.18</span><span class="cts_passage">However, the fan was handed round to all the ladies. Madame Guibal barely glanced at it. She was a tall, thin woman, with red hair, and a face full of indifference, in which her grey eyes, occasionally penetrating her unconcerned air, cast the terrible gleams of selfishness. She was never seen out with her husband, a barrister well-known at the Palais de Justice, who led, it was said, a pretty free life, dividing himself between his law business and his pleasures.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh,” murmured she, passing the fan to Madame de Boves, “I've scarcely bought one in my life. One always receives too many of such things.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.20</span><span class="cts_passage">The countess replied with delicate malice: “You are fortunate, my dear, in having a gallant husband.” And bending over to her daughter, a tall girl of twenty, she added: “Just look at the monogram, Blanche. What pretty work! It's the monogram that must have increased the price like that.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.21</span><span class="cts_passage">Madame de Boves had just turned forty. She was a superb woman, with the neck of a goddess, a large regular face, and big sleepy eyes, whom her husband, Inspector-General of the Stud, had married for her beauty. She appeared quite moved by the delicacy of the monogram, as if seized with a desire the emotion of which made her turn pale, and turning round suddenly, she continued: “Give us your opinion, Monsieur Mouret. Is it too dear--two hundred francs for this mount?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.22</span><span class="cts_passage">Mouret had remained standing in the midst of the five women, smiling, taking an interest in what interested them. He picked up the fan, examined it, and was about to give his opinion, when the footman opened the door and announced:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“Madame Marty.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.24</span><span class="cts_passage">And there entered a thin, ugly woman, ravaged with the small-pox, dressed with a complicated elegance. She was of uncertain age, her thirty-five years appearing sometimes equal to thirty, and sometimes to forty, according to the intensity of the nervous fever which agitated her. A red leather bag, which she had not let go, hung from her right hand.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“Dear madame,” said she to Henriette, “excuse me bringing my bag. Just fancy, as I was coming along I went into The Paradise, and as I have again been very extravagant, I did not like to leave it in my cab for fear of being robbed.” But having perceived Mouret, she resumed laughingly: “Ah! sir, I didn't mean to give you an advertisement, for I didn't know you were here. But you really have some extraordinary fine lace just now.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.26</span><span class="cts_passage">This turned the attention from the fan, which the young man laid on the table. The ladies were all anxious to see what Madame Marty had bought. She was known to be very extravagant, totally unable to resist temptation, strict in her conduct and incapable of yielding to a lover, but weak and cowardly, easily conquered before the least bit of finery. Daughter of a city clerk, she was ruining her husband, a master at the Lycée Bonaparte, who was obliged to double his salary of six thousand francs a year by giving private lessons, in order to meet the constantly increasing household expenses. She did not open her bag, but held it tight on her lap, and commenced to talk about her daughter Valentine, fourteen years old, one of her dearest coquetries, for she dressed her like herself, with all the fashionable novelties of which she submitted to the irresistible seduction.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“You know,” she said, “they are making dresses trimmed with a narrow lace for young girls this winter. So when I saw a very pretty Valenciennes----”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.28</span><span class="cts_passage">And she at last decided to open her bag. The ladies were stretching out their necks, when, in the midst of the silence, the door-bell was heard.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“It's my husband,” stammered Madame Marty, very confused. “He promised to fetch me on leaving the Lycée Bonaparte.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.30</span><span class="cts_passage">She quickly shut the bag again, and put it under her chair with an instinctive movement. All the ladies set up a laugh. This made her blush for her precipitation, and she put the bag on her knees again, explaining that men never understood, and that they need not know.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“Monsieur de Boves, Monsieur de Vallagnosc,” announced the footman.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.32</span><span class="cts_passage">It was quite a surprise. Madame de Boves herself did not expect her husband. The latter, a fine man, wearing a moustache and an imperial with the military correctness so much liked at the Tuileries, kissed the hand of Madame Desforges, whom he had known as a young girl at her father's. And he made way to allow his companion, a tall, pale fellow, of an aristocratic poverty of blood, to make his bow to the lady of the house. But the conversation had hardly recommenced when two exclamations were heard:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“What! Is that you, Paul?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why, Octave!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.35</span><span class="cts_passage">Mouret and Vallagnosc then shook hands, much to Madame Desforges's surprise. They knew each other, then? Of course, they had grown up side by side at the college at Plassans, and it was quite by chance they had not met at her house before. However, with their hands still united, they went into the little drawing-room, just as the servant brought in the tea, a china service on a silver waiter, which he placed near Madame Desforges, on a small round marble table with a light copper mounting. The ladies drew up and began talking louder, all speaking at once, producing a cross-fire of short disjointed sentences; whilst Monsieur de Boves, standing up behind them, put in an occasional word with the gallantry of a handsome functionary. The vast room, so prettily and cheerfully furnished, became merrier still with these gossiping voices, and the frequent laughter.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah! Paul, old boy,” repeated Mouret.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.37</span><span class="cts_passage">He was seated near Vallagnosc, on a sofa. And alone in the little drawing-room, very coquettish with its pretty silk hangings, out of hearing of the ladies, and not even seeing them, except through the open door, the two old friends commenced grinning, examining each other's looks, exchanging slaps on the knees. Their whole youthful career was recalled, the old college at Plassans, with its two courtyards, its damp classrooms, and the dining-room in which they had consumed so much cod-fish, and the dormitories where the pillows used to fly from bed to bed as soon as the monitor began to snore. Paul, belonging to an old parliamentary family, noble, poor, and proud, was a good scholar, always at the top of his class, continually held up as an example by the master, who prophesied for him a brilliant future; whilst Octave remained at the bottom, stuck amongst the dunces, fat and jolly, indulging in all sorts of pleasures outside. Notwithstanding the difference in their characters, a fast friendship had rendered them inseparable, until their final examinations, which they passed, the one with honours, the other in a passable manner after two vexatious trials. Then they went out into the world, and had now met again, after ten years, already changed and looking older.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well,” said Mouret, “what's become of you?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“Nothing at all,” replied the other.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.40</span><span class="cts_passage">Vallagnosc, in the joy of their meeting, retained his tired and disenchanted air; and as his friend, astonished, insisted, saying: “But you must do something. What do you do?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“Nothing,” replied he.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.42</span><span class="cts_passage">Octave commenced to laugh. Nothing! that wasn't enough. Little by little he succeeded in drawing Paul out to tell his story. It was the usual story of penniless younger sons, who think themselves obliged by their birth to choose a liberal profession, burying themselves in a sort of vain mediocrity, happy to escape starvation, notwithstanding their numerous degrees. He had studied law by a sort of family tradition; and had since remained a burden on his widowed mother, who even then hardly knew how to dispose of her two daughters. Having at last got quite ashamed, he left the three women to vegetate on the remnants of their fortune, and accepted an appointment in the Ministry of the Interior, where he buried himself like a mole in its hole.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“What do you get there?” resumed Mouret.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.44</span><span class="cts_passage">“Three thousand francs.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“But that's pitiful pay! Ah! old man, I'm really sorry for you. What! a clever fellow like you, who floored all of us I And they only give you three thousand francs a year, after having already ground you down for five years! No, it isn't right!” He interrupted himself, and returned to his own doings. “As for me, I made them a humble bow. You know what I'm doing?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes,” said Vallagnosc, “I heard you were in business. You've got that big place in the Place Gaillon, haven't you?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“That's it. Counter-jumper, my boy!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.48</span><span class="cts_passage">Mouret raised his head, again slapped him on the knee, and repeated, with the solid gaiety of a fellow who did not blush for the trade by which he was making his fortune:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“Counter-jumper, and no mistake! You remember, no doubt, I didn't bite much at their machines, although at heart I never thought myself duller than the others. When I took my degree, just to please the family, I could have become a barrister or a doctor quite as easily as any of my school-fellows, but those trades frightened me. I saw so many who were starving at them that I just threw them over without the least regret, and pitched head-first into business.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.50</span><span class="cts_passage">Vallognosc smiled with an awkward air, and ultimately said: “It's very certain your degree can't be much good to you for selling calico.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.51</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well!” replied Mouret, joyously, “all I ask is, that it shall not stand in my way, and you know, when one has been stupid enough to burden one's self with it, it is difficult to get rid of it. One goes at a tortoise's pace through life, whilst those who are bare-footed run like madmen.” Then, noticing that his friend seemed troubled, he took his hand in his, and continued: “Come, come, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but confess that your degrees have not satisfied any of your wants. Do you know that my manager in the silk department will draw more than twelve thousand francs this year. Just so! a fellow of very clear intelligence, whose knowledge is confined to spelling, and the first four rules. The ordinary salesmen in my place make from three to four thousand francs a year, more than you can earn yourself; and their education was not so expensive as yours, nor were they launched into the world with a written promise to conquer it. Of course, it is not everything to make money; but between the poor devils possessed of a smattering of science who now block up the liberal professions, without earning enough to keep themselves from starving, and the practical fellows armed for life's struggle, knowing every branch of their trade, by Jove! I don't hesitate a moment, I'm for the latter against the former, I think they thoroughly understand the age they live in!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.52</span><span class="cts_passage">His voice had become impassioned. Henriette, who was pouring out the tea, turned her head. When he caught her smile, at the further end of the large drawing-room, and saw the other ladies were listening, he was the first to make merry over his own big phrases.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.53</span><span class="cts_passage">“In short, old man, every counter-jumper who commences, has, at the present day, a chance of becoming a millionaire.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.54</span><span class="cts_passage">Vallagnosc threw himself back on the sofa indolently, half-closing his eyes in a fatigued and disdainful attitude, in which a suspicion of affectation was added to his real hereditary exhaustion.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.55</span><span class="cts_passage">“Bah!” murmured he, “life isn't worth all that trouble. There is nothing worth living for.” And as Mouret, shocked, looked at him with an air of surprise, he added: “Everything happens and nothing happens; one may as well stay with one's arms folded.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.56</span><span class="cts_passage">He then explained his pessimism--the mediocrities and the abortions of existence. For a time he had thought of literature, but his intercourse with certain poets had filled him with universal despair. He always arrived at the conclusion that all effort was useless, every hour equally weary and empty, and the world incurably stupid and dull. All enjoyment was a failure, and there was no pleasure in wrong-doing even.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.57</span><span class="cts_passage">“Just tell me, do you enjoy life yourself?” asked he at last.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.58</span><span class="cts_passage">Mouret was now in a state of astonished indignation, and exclaimed: “What? Do I enjoy myself? What are you talking about? Why, of course I do, my boy, and even when things give way, for then I am furious at hearing them cracking. I am a passionate fellow myself, and don't take life quietly; that's what interests me in it perhaps.” He glanced towards the drawing-room, and lowered his voice. “Oh! there are some women who've bothered me awfully, I must confess. But when I've got hold of one, I keep her. She doesn't always escape me, and then I take my share, I assure you. But it is not so much the women, for to speak truly, I don't care a hang for them; it's the wish to act--to create, in short. You have an idea; you fight for it, you hammer it into people's heads, and you see it grow and triumph. Ah! yes, my boy, I enjoy life!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.59</span><span class="cts_passage">All the joy of action, all the gaiety of existence, resounded in these words. He repeated that he went with the times. Really, a man must be badly constituted, have his brain and limbs out of order, to refuse to work in an age of such vast undertakings, when the entire century was pressing forward with giant strides. And he laughed at the despairing ones, the disgusted ones, the pessimists, all those weak, sickly members of our budding sciences, who assumed the weeping airs of poets, or the mincing ways of sceptics, amidst the immense activity of the present day. A fine part to play, proper and intelligent, that of yawning before other people's labour!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.60</span><span class="cts_passage">“That's my only pleasure, yawning in other's faces,” said Vallagnosc, smiling with his cold look.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.61</span><span class="cts_passage">At this Mouret's passion subsided, and he became affectionate again. “Ah, Paul, you're not changed. Just as paradoxical as ever! However, we've not met to quarrel. Each one has his own ideas, fortunately. But you must come and see my machine at work; you'll see it isn't a bad idea. Come, what news? Your mother and sisters are quite well, I hope? And weren't you supposed to get married at Plassans, about six months ago?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.62</span><span class="cts_passage">A sudden movement made by Vallagnosc stopped him; and as the former was looking round the drawing-room with an anxious expression, Mouret also turned round, and noticed that Mademoiselle de Boves was closely watching them. Blanche, tall and stout, resembled her mother; but her face was already puffed out, her large, coarse features swollen with unhealthy fat. Paul, in reply to a discreet question, intimated that nothing was yet settled; perhaps nothing would be settled. He had made the young person's acquaintance at Madame Desforges's, where he had visited a good deal last winter, but where he very rarely came now, which explained why he had not met Octave there sooner. In their turn, the De Boves invited him, and he was especially fond of the father, a very amiable man, formerly well known about town, who had retired into his present position. On the other hand, no money. Madame de Boves having brought her husband nothing but her Juno-like beauty as a marriage portion, the family were living poorly on the last mortgaged farm, to which modest revenue was added, fortunately, the nine thousand francs a year drawn by the count as Inspector-General of the Stud. And the ladies, mother and daughter, kept very short of money by him, impoverished by tender escapades outside, were sometimes reduced to turning their dresses themselves.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.63</span><span class="cts_passage">“In that case, why marry?” was Mouret's simple question.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.64</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well! I can't go on like this for ever,” said Vallagnosc, with a weary movement of the eyelids. “Besides, there are certain expectations; we are waiting the death of an aunt.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.65</span><span class="cts_passage">However, Mouret still kept his eye on Monsieur de Boves, who, seated next to Madame Guibal, was most attentive, and laughing tenderly like a man on an amorous campaign; he turned to his friend with such a significant twinkle of the eye that the latter added:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.66</span><span class="cts_passage">“Not that one. At least not yet. The misfortune is, that his duty calls him to the four corners of France, to the breeding dépôts, so that he has continual pretexts for absenting himself. Last month, whilst his wife supposed him to be at Perpignan, he was living at an hotel, in an out-of-the-way neighbourhood, with a music-mistress.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.67</span><span class="cts_passage">There ensued a pause. Then the young man, who was also watching the count's gallantries towards Madame Guibal, resumed in a low tone: “Really, I think you are right. The more so as the dear lady is not exactly a saint, if all they say is true. There's a very amusing story about her and an officer. But just look at him! Isn't he comical, magnetising her with his eyes? The old-fashioned gallantry, my dear fellow! I adore that man, and if I marry his daughter, he can safely say it's for his sake!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.68</span><span class="cts_passage">Mouret laughed, greatly amused. He questioned Vallagnosc again, and when he found that the first idea of a marriage between him and Blanche came from Madame Desforges, he thought the story better still. That good Henriette took a widow's delight in marrying people, so much so, that when she had provided for the girls, she sometimes allowed their fathers to choose friends from her company; but all so naturally, with such a good grace, that no one ever found any food for scandal. And Mouret, who loved her with the love of an active, busy man, accustomed to reducing his tenderness to figures, forgot all his calculations of captivation, and felt for her a comrade's friendship.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.69</span><span class="cts_passage">At that moment she appeared at the door of the little drawing-room, followed by a gentleman, about sixty years old, whose entry had not been observed by the two friends. Occasionally the ladies' voices became sharper, accompanied by the tinkling of the small spoons in the china cups; and there was heard, from time to time, in the interval of a short silence, the noise of a saucer laid down too roughly on the marble table. A sudden gleam of the setting sun, which had just emerged from behind a thick cloud, gilded the top of the chestnut-trees in the gardens, and streamed through the windows in a red, golden flame, the fire of which lighted up the brocatel and brass-work of the furniture.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.70</span><span class="cts_passage">“This way, my dear baron,” said Madame Desforges. “Allow me to introduce Monsieur Octave Mouret, who is longing to express the admiration he feels for you.” And turning round towards Octave, she added: “Baron Hartmann.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.71</span><span class="cts_passage">[Illustration: 0077]</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.72</span><span class="cts_passage">A smile played on the old man's lips. He was a short, vigorous man, with a large Alsatian head, and a heavy face, which lighted up with a gleam of intelligence at the slightest curl of his mouth, the slightest movement of his eyelids. For the last fortnight he had resisted Henriette's wish that he should consent to this interview; not that he felt any immoderate jealousy, accepting, like a man of the world, his position of father; but because it was the third friend Henriette had introduced to him, and he was afraid of becoming ridiculous at last. So that on approaching Octave he put on the discreet smile of a rich protector, who, if good enough to show himself charming, does not consent to be a dupe.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.73</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh! sir,” said Mouret, with his Southern enthusiasm, “the Credit Immobiliers last operation was really astonishing! You cannot think how happy and proud I am to know you.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.74</span><span class="cts_passage">“Too kind, sir, too kind,” repeated the baron, still smiling.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.75</span><span class="cts_passage">Henriette looked at them with her clear eyes without any awkwardness, standing between the two, lifting her head, going from one to the other; and, in her lace dress, which revealed her delicate neck and wrists, she appeared delighted to see them so friendly together.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.76</span><span class="cts_passage">“Gentlemen,” said she at last, “I leave you to your conversation.” Then, turning towards Paul, who had got up, she resumed: “Will you accept of a cup of tea, Monsieur de Vallagnosc?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.77</span><span class="cts_passage">“With pleasure, madame,” and they both returned to the drawing-room.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.78</span><span class="cts_passage">Mouret resumed his place on the sofa, when Baron Hartmann had sat down; the young man then broke out in praise of the Credit Immobiliers operations. From that he went on to the subject so near his heart, speaking of the new thoroughfare, of the lengthening of the Rue Reaumur, of which they were going to open a section under the name of the Rue du Dix-Décembre, between the Place de la Bourse and the Place de l'Opera. It had been declared a work of public utility eighteen months previously; the expropriation jury had just been appointed. The whole neighbourhood was excited about this new opening, anxiously awaiting the commencement of the work, taking an interest in the condemned houses. Mouret had been waiting three years for this work--first, in the expectation of an increase of business; secondly, with certain schemes of enlargement which he dared not openly avow, so extensive were his ideas. As the Rue du Dix-Décembre was to cut through the Rue de Choiseul and the Rue de la Michodière, he saw The Ladies' Paradise invading the whole block, surrounded by these streets and the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin; he already imagined it with a princely frontage in the new thoroughfare, lord and master of the conquered city. Hence his strong desire to make Baron Hartmann's acquaintance, when he learnt that the Crédit Immobilier had made a contract with the authorities to open and build the Rue du Dix-Décembre, on condition that they received the frontage ground on each side of the street.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.79</span><span class="cts_passage">“Really,” repeated he, trying to assume a naïve look, “you'll hand over the street ready made, with sewers, pavements, and gas lamps. And the frontage ground will suffice to compensate you. Oh! it's curious, very curious!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.80</span><span class="cts_passage">At last he came to the delicate point. He was aware that the Crédit Immobilier was buying up the houses which surrounded The Ladies' Paradise, not only those which were to fall under the demolisher's hands, but the others as well, those which were to remain standing; and he suspected the projectment of some future establishment He was very anxious about the enlargements of which he continued to extend the dream, seized with fear at the idea of one day clashing with a powerful company, owning property which they certainly would not part with. It was precisely this fear which had decided him to establish a connection immediately between himself and the baron--the amiable connection of a woman, so powerful between men of a gallant nature. No doubt he could have seen the financier in his office, and talked over the affair in question at his ease; but he felt himself stronger in Henriette's house; he knew how much the mutual possession of a mistress serves to render men pliable and tender. To be both near her, within the beloved perfume of her presence, to have her ready to convince them with a smile, seemed to him a certainty of success.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.81</span><span class="cts_passage">“Haven't you bought the old Hôtel Duvillard, that old building next to mine?” he asked suddenly.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.82</span><span class="cts_passage">The baron hesitated a moment, and then denied it. But Mouret looked in his face and smiled, playing, from that moment, the part of a good young man, open-hearted, simple, and straightforward in business.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.83</span><span class="cts_passage">“Look here, baron,” said he, “as I have the unexpected honour of meeting you, I must make a confession. Oh, I don't ask you any of your secrets, but I am going to entrust you with mine, certain that I couldn't place them in wiser hands. Besides, I want your advice. I have long wished to call and see you, but dared not do so.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.84</span><span class="cts_passage">He did make his confession, he related his start, not even concealing the financial crisis through which he was passing in the midst of his triumph. Everything was brought up, the successive enlargements, the profits continually put back into the business, the sums brought by his employees, the house risking its existence at every fresh sale, in which the entire capital was staked, as it were, on a single throw of the dice. However, it was not money he wanted, for he had a fanatic's faith in his customers; his ambition ran higher; he proposed to the baron a partnership, into which the Credit Immobilier should bring the colossal palace he saw in his dreams, whilst he, for his part, would give his genius and the business already created. The estate could be valued, nothing appeared to him easier to realise.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.85</span><span class="cts_passage">“What are you going to do with your land and buildings?” asked he, persistently. “You have a plan, no doubt. But I'm quite certain your idea is not so good as mine. Think of that. We build a gallery on the ground, we pull down or re-arrange the houses, and we open the most extensive establishment in Paris--a bazaar which will bring in millions.” And he let slip the fervent heartfelt exclamation: “Ah! if I could only do without you! But you get hold of everything now. Besides, I shall never have the necessary capital. Come, we must come to an understanding. It would be a crime not to do so.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.86</span><span class="cts_passage">“How you go ahead, my dear sir!” Baron Hartmann contented himself with replying. “What an imagination!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.87</span><span class="cts_passage">He shook his head, and continued to smile, determined not to return confidence for confidence. The intention of the Crédit Immobilier was to create in the Rue du Dix-Décembre a rival to the Grand Hôtel, a luxurious establishment, the central position of which would attract foreigners. At the same time, as the hôtel was only to occupy a certain, frontage, the baron could also have entertained Mouret's idea, and treated for the rest of the block of houses, occupying a vast surface. But he had already advanced funds to two of Henriette's friends, and he was getting tired of his position as complacent protector. Besides, notwithstanding his passion for activity, which prompted him to open his purse to every fellow of intelligence and courage, Mouret's commercial genius astonished more than captivated him. Was it not a fanciful, imprudent operation, this gigantic shop? Would he not risk a certain failure in thus enlarging out of all bounds the drapery trade? In short, he didn't believe in it; he refused.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.88</span><span class="cts_passage">“No doubt the idea is attractive, but it's a poet's idea. Where would you find the customers to fill such a cathedral?” Mouret looked at him for a moment silently, as if stupefied at his refusal. Was it possible?--a man of such foresight, who smelt money at no matter what depth! And suddenly, with an extremely eloquent gesture, he pointed to the ladies in the drawing-room and exclaimed: “There are my customers!” The sun was going down, the golden-red flame was now but a pale light, dying away in a farewell gleam on the silk of the hangings and the panels of the furniture. At this approach of twilight, an intimacy bathed the large room in a sweet softness. While Monsieur de Boves and Paul de Vallagnosc were talking near one of the windows, their eyes wandering far away into the gardens, the ladies had closed up, forming in the middle of the room a narrow circle of petticoats, from which issued sounds of laughter, whispered words, ardent questions and replies, all the passion felt by woman for expenditure and finery. They were talking about dress, and Madame de Boves was describing a costume she had seen at a ball.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.89</span><span class="cts_passage">“First of all, a mauve silk skirt, then over that flounces of old Alençon lace, twelve inches deep.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.90</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh! is it possible!” exclaimed Madame Marty. “Some women are fortunate!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.91</span><span class="cts_passage">Baron Hartmann, who had followed Mouret's gesture, was looking at the ladies through the door, which was wide open. He was listening to them with one ear, whilst the young man, inflamed by the desire to convince him, went deeper into the question, explaining the mechanism of the new style of drapery business. This branch of commerce was now based on a rapid and continual turning over of the capital, which it was necessary to turn into goods as often as possible in the same year. Thus, that year his capital, which only amounted to five hundred thousand francs, had been turned over four times, and had thus produced business to the amount of two millions. But this was a mere trifle, which could be increased tenfold, for later on he certainly hoped to turn over the capital fifteen or twenty times in certain departments.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.92</span><span class="cts_passage">“You will understand, baron, that the whole system lies in this. It is very simple, but it had to be found out. We don't want a very large working capital; our sole effort is to get rid as quickly as possible of our stock to replace it by another, which will give our capital as many times its interest. In this way we can content ourselves with a very small profit; as our general expenses amount to the enormous figure of sixteen per cent., and as we seldom make more than twenty per cent, on our goods, it is only a net profit of four per cent at most; but this will finish by bringing in millions when we can operate on considerable quantities of goods incessantly renewed. You follow me, don't you? nothing can be clearer.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.93</span><span class="cts_passage">The baron shook his head again. He who had entertained the boldest combinations, of whom people still quoted the daring flights at the time of the introduction of gas, still remained uneasy and obstinate.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.94</span><span class="cts_passage">“I quite understand,” said he; “you sell cheap to sell a quantity, and you sell a quantity to sell cheap. But you must sell, and I repeat my former question: Whom will you sell to? How do you hope to keep up such a colossal sale?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.95</span><span class="cts_passage">The sudden burst of a voice, coming from the drawing-room, cut short Mouret's explanation. It was Madame Guibal, who was saying she would have preferred the flounces of old Alençon down the front only.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.96</span><span class="cts_passage">“But, my dear,” said Madame de Boves, “the front was covered with it as well. I never saw anything richer.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.97</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, that's a good idea,” resumed Madame Desforges, “I've got several yards of Alençon somewhere; I must look them up for a trimming.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.98</span><span class="cts_passage">And the voices fell again, becoming nothing but a murmur. Prices were quoted, quite a traffic stirred up their desires, the ladies were buying lace by the mile.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.99</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why!” said Mouret, when he could speak, “we can sell what we like when we know how to sell! There lies our triumph.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.100</span><span class="cts_passage">And with his southern spirit, he showed the new business at work in warm, glowing phrases which evoked whole pictures. First came the wonderful power of the piling up of the goods, all accumulated at one point, sustaining and pushing each other, never any stand-still, the article of the season always on hand; and from counter to counter the customer found herself seized, buying here the material, further on the cotton, elsewhere the mantle, everything necessary to complete her dress in fact, then falling into unforeseen purchases, yielding to her longing for the useless and the pretty. He then went on to sing the praises of the plain figure system. The great revolution in the business sprung from this fortunate inspiration. If the old-fashioned small shops were dying out it was because they could not struggle against the low prices guaranteed by the tickets. The competition was now going on under the very eyes of the public; a look into the windows enabled them to contrast the prices; every shop was lowering its rates, contenting itself with the smallest possible profit; no cheating, no stroke of fortune prepared long beforehand on an article sold at double its value, but current operations, a regular percentage on all goods, success depending solely on the orderly working of a sale all the larger from the fact of its being carried on in broad daylight. Was it not an astonishing creation? It was causing a revolution in the market, transforming Paris, for it was made of woman's flesh and blood.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.101</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have the women, I don't care a hang for the rest!” said Mouret, in a brutal confession which passion snatched from him.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.102</span><span class="cts_passage">At this cry Baron Hartmann appeared moved. His smile lost its touch of irony; he looked at the young man, won over gradually by his confidence, feeling a growing tenderness for him.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.103</span><span class="cts_passage">“Hush!” murmured he, paternally, “they will hear you.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.104</span><span class="cts_passage">But the ladies were now all speaking at once, so excited that they weren't even listening to each other. Madame de Boves was finishing the description of a dinner-dress; a mauve silk tunic, draped and caught up by bows of lace; the bodice cut very low, with more bows of lace on the shoulders.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.105</span><span class="cts_passage">“You'll see,” said she. “I am having a bodice made like it, with some satin----”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.106</span><span class="cts_passage">“I,” interrupted Madame Bourdelais, “I wanted some velvet. Oh! such a bargain!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.107</span><span class="cts_passage">Madame Marty asked: “How much for the silk?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.108</span><span class="cts_passage">And off they started again, all together. Madame Guibal, Henriette, and Blanche were measuring, cutting out, and making up. It was a pillage of material, a ransacking of all the shops, an appetite for luxury which expended itself in toilettes longed for and dreamed of--such a happiness to find themselves in an atmosphere of finery, that they lived buried in it, as in the warm air necessary to their existence.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.109</span><span class="cts_passage">Mouret, however, had glanced towards the other drawingroom, and in a few phrases whispered into the baron's ear, as if he were confiding to him one of those amorous secrets that men sometimes risk among themselves, he finished explaining the mechanism of modern commerce. And, above the facts already given, right at the summit, appeared the exploitation of woman. Everything depended on that, the capital incessantly renewed, the system of piling up goods, the cheapness which attracts, the marking in plain figures which tranquilises. It was for woman that all the establishments were struggling in wild competition; it was woman that they were continually catching in the snare of their bargains, after bewildering her with their displays. They had awakened new desires in her flesh; they were an immense temptation, before which she succumbed fatally, yielding at first to reasonable purchases of useful articles for the household, then tempted by their coquetry, then devoured. In increasing their business tenfold, in popularising luxury, they became a terrible spending agency, ravaging the households, working up the fashionable folly of the hour, always dearer. And if woman reigned in their shops like a queen, cajoled, flattered, overwhelmed with attentions, she was an amorous one, on whom her subjects traffic, and who pays with a drop of her blood each fresh caprice. Through the very gracefulness of his gallantry, Mouret thus allowed to appear the brutality of a Jew, selling woman by the pound. He raised a temple to her, had her covered with incense by a legion of shopmen, created the rite of a new religion, thinking of nothing but her, continually seeking to imagine more powerful seductions; and, behind her back, when he had emptied her purse and shattered her nerves, he was full of the secret scorn of a man to whom a woman had just been stupid enough to yield herself.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.110</span><span class="cts_passage">“Once have the women on your side,” whispered he to the baron, and laughing boldly, “you could sell the very world.” Now the baron understood. A few sentences had sufficed, he guessed the rest, and such a gallant exploitation inflamed him, stirring up in him the memory of his past life of pleasure. His eyes twinkled in a knowing way, and he ended by looking with an air of admiration at the inventor of this machine for devouring the women. It was really clever. He made the same remark as Bourdoncle, suggested to him by his long experience: “You know they'll make you suffer for it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.111</span><span class="cts_passage">But Mouret shrugged his shoulders in a movement of overwhelming disdain. They all belonged to him, were his property, and he belonged to none of them. After having drawn from them his fortune and his pleasure, he intended to throw them all over for those who might still find their account in them. It was the rational, cold disdain of a Southerner and a speculator.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.112</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well! my dear baron,” asked he in conclusion, “will you join me? Does this affair appear possible to you?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.113</span><span class="cts_passage">The baron, half conquered, did not wish, however, to engage himself yet A doubt remained beneath the charm which was gradually operating on him. He was going to reply in an evasive manner, when a pressing call from the ladies spared him the trouble. Voices were repeating, amidst silvery laughter: “Monsieur Mouret! Monsieur Mouret!” And as the latter, annoyed at being interrupted, pretended not to hear, Madame de Boves, who had just got up, came as far as the door of the little drawing-room.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.114</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are wanted, Monsieur Mouret. It isn't very gallant of you to bury yourself in a corner to talk over business.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.115</span><span class="cts_passage">He then decided to go, with an apparent good grace, an air of rapture which astonished the baron. Both rose up and passed into the other drawing-room.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.116</span><span class="cts_passage">“But I am quite at your service, ladies,” said he on entering, a smile on his lips.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.117</span><span class="cts_passage">He was greeted with a burst of triumph. He was obliged to go further forward; the ladies made room for him in their midst The sun had just gone down behind the trees in the gardens, the day was departing, a fine shadow was gradually invading the vast apartment. It was the tender hour of twilight, that minute of discreet voluptuousness in the Parisian houses, between the dying brightness of the street and the lighting of the lamps downstairs. Monsieur de Boves and Vallagnosc, still standing up before a window, threw a shadow on the carpet: whilst, motionless in the last gleam of light which came in by the other window, Monsieur Marty, who had quietly entered, and whom the conversation of these ladies about dress had completely confused, placed his poor profile, a frock-coat, scanty but clean, his face pale and wan from teaching.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.118</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is your sale still fixed for next Monday?” Madame Marty was just asking.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.119</span><span class="cts_passage">“Certainly, madame,” replied Mouret, in a soft, sweet voice, an actor's voice, which he assumed when speaking to women.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.120</span><span class="cts_passage">Henriette then intervened. “We are all going, you know. They say you are preparing wonders.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.121</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh! wonders!” murmured he, with an air of modest fatuity. “I simply try to deserve your patronage.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.122</span><span class="cts_passage">But they pressed him with questions: Madame Bourdelais, Madame Guibal, Blanche even wanted to know.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.123</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come, give us some details,” repeated Madame de Boves, persistently. “You are making us die of curiosity.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.124</span><span class="cts_passage">And they were surrounding him, when Henriette observed that he had not even taken a cup of tea. It was distressing. Four of them set about serving him, but on condition that he would answer them afterwards. Henriette poured it out, Madame Marty held the cup, whilst Madame de Boves and Madame Bourdelais contended for the honour of sweetening it. Then, when he had declined to sit down, and commenced to drink his tea slowly, standing up in the midst of them, they all approached, imprisoning him in the narrow circle of their skirts; and with their heads raised, their eyes sparkling, they sat there smiling at him.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.125</span><span class="cts_passage">“Your silk, your Paris Paradise, that all the papers are taking about?” resumed Madame Marty, impatiently.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.126</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh!” replied he, “an extraordinary article, coarse-grained, supple and strong. You'll see it, ladies, and you'll see it nowhere else, for we have bought the exclusive right of it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.127</span><span class="cts_passage">“Really! a fine silk at five francs twelve sous!” said Madame Bourdelais, enthusiastic. “One cannot credit it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.128</span><span class="cts_passage">Ever since the advertisement had appeared, this silk had occupied a considerable place in their daily life. They talked of it, promising themselves some of it, worked up with desire and doubt. And, beneath the gossiping curiosity with which they overwhelmed the young man, there appeared their various temperaments as buyers.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.129</span><span class="cts_passage">Madame Marty, carried away by her rage for spending, took everything at The Ladies' Paradise, without choosing, just as the articles appeared; Madame Guibal walked about the shop for hours without ever buying anything, happy and satisfied to simply feast her eyes; Madame de Boves, short of money, always tortured by some immoderate wish, nourished a feeling of rancour against the goods she could not carry away; Madame Bourdelais, with the sharp eye of a careful practical housewife, made straight for the bargains, using the big establishments with such a clever housewife's skill that she saved a heap of money; and lastly, Henriette, who, very elegant, only procured certain articles there, such as gloves, hosiery, and her coarser linen.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.130</span><span class="cts_passage">“We have other stuffs of astonishing cheapness and richness,” continued Mouret, with his musical voice. “For instance, I recommend you our Golden Grain, a taffeta of incomparable brilliancy. In the fancy silks there are some charming lines, designs chosen from among thousands by our buyer: and in velvets you will find an exceedingly rich collection of shades. I warn you that cloth will be greatly worn this year; you'll see our checks and our cheviots.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.131</span><span class="cts_passage">They had ceased to interrupt him, and narrowed the circle, their mouths half open with a vague smile, their eager faces close to his, as in a sudden rush of their whole being towards the tempter. Their eyes grew dim, a slight shudder ran through them. All this time he retained his calm, conquering air, amidst the intoxicating perfumes which their hair exhaled; and between each sentence he continued to sip a little of his tea, the aroma of which cooled those sharper odours, in which there was a particle of the savage. Before a captivating grace so thoroughly master of itself, strong enough to play with woman in this way without being overcome by the intoxication which she exhales, Baron Hartmann, who had not ceased to look at him, felt his admiration increasing.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.132</span><span class="cts_passage">“So cloth will be worn?” resumed Madame Marty, whose ravished face sparkled with coquettish passion.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.133</span><span class="cts_passage">Madame Bourdelais, who kept a cool look-out, said, in her turn: “Your sale of remnants takes place on Thursday, doesn't it? I shall wait. I have all my little ones to clothe.” And turning her delicate blonde head towards the mistress of the house: “Sauveur is still your dressmaker, I suppose?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.134</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes,” replied Henriette, “Sauveur is very dear, but she is the only one in Paris who knows how to make a bodice. Besides, Monsieur Mouret may say what he likes, she has the prettiest designs, designs that are not seen anywhere else. I can't bear to see my dresses on every woman's back.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.135</span><span class="cts_passage">Mouret smiled discreetly at first. Then he intimated that Madame Sauveur bought her material at his shop; no doubt she went to the manufacturers direct for certain designs of which she acquired the sole right of sale; but for all black silks, for instance, she watched for The Paradise bargains, laying in a considerable stock, which she disposed of at double and treble the price she gave.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.136</span><span class="cts_passage">“Thus I am quite sure her buyers will snap up all our Paris Paradise. Why should she go to the manufacturers and pay dearer for this silk than she would at my place? On my word of honour, we shall sell it at a loss.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.137</span><span class="cts_passage">This was a decisive blow for the ladies. The idea of getting goods below cost price awoke in them all the greed felt by women, whose enjoyment as buyers is doubled when they think they are robbing the tradesman. He knew them to be incapable of resisting anything cheap.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.138</span><span class="cts_passage">“But we sell everything for nothing!” exclaimed he gaily, taking up Madame Desforges's fan, which was behind him on the table. “For instance, here's this fan. I don't know what it cost.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.139</span><span class="cts_passage">“The Chantilly lace was twenty-five francs, and the mounting cost two hundred,” said Henriette.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.140</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, the Chantilly isn't dear. However, we have the same at eighteen francs; as for the mount, my dear madame, it's a shameful robbery. I should not dare to sell one like it for more than ninety francs.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.141</span><span class="cts_passage">“Just what I said!” exclaimed Madame Bourdelais.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.142</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ninety francs!” murmured Madame de Boves; “one must be very poor indeed to go without one at that price.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.143</span><span class="cts_passage">She had taken up the fan, and was again examining it with her daughter Blanche; and, on her large regular face, in her big sleepy eyes, there arose an expression of the suppressed and despairing longing of a caprice in which she could not indulge. The fan once more went the round of the ladies, amidst various remarks and exclamations. Monsieur de Boves and Vallagnosc, however, had left the window. Whilst the former had returned to his place behind Madame Guibal, the charms of whose bust he was admiring, with his correct and superior air, the young man was leaning over Blanche, endeavouring to find something agreeable to say.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.144</span><span class="cts_passage">“Don't you think it rather gloomy, mademoiselle, this white mount and black lace?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.145</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh,” replied she, gravely, not a blush colouring her inflated cheeks, “I once saw one made of mother-of-pearl and white lace. Something truly virginal!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.146</span><span class="cts_passage">Monsieur de Boves, who had doubtless observed the heartbroken, longing looks with which his wife was following the fan, at last added his word to the conversation. “These flimsy things don't last long, they soon break,” said he.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.147</span><span class="cts_passage">“Of course they do!” declared Madame Guibal, with an air of indifference. “I'm tired of having mine mended.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.148</span><span class="cts_passage">For several minutes, Madame Marty, excited by the conversation, was feverishly turning her red leather bag about on her lap, for she had not yet been able to show her purchases. She was burning to display them, with a sort of sensual desire; and, suddenly forgetting her husband's presence, she took out a few yards of narrow lace wound on a piece of cardboard.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.149</span><span class="cts_passage">“It's the Valenciennes for my daughter,” said she. “It's an inch and a half wide. Isn't it delicious? One franc eighteen sous.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.150</span><span class="cts_passage">The lace was passed from hand to hand. The ladies were astonished. Mouret assured them he sold these little trimmings at cost price. However, Madame Marty had closed the bag, as if to conceal certain things she could not show. But after the success obtained by the Valenciennes she was unable to resist the temptation of taking out a handkerchief.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.151</span><span class="cts_passage">“There was this handkerchief as well. Real Brussels, my dear. Oh! a bargain! Twenty francs!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.152</span><span class="cts_passage">And after that the bag became inexhaustible, she blushed with pleasure, a modesty like that of a woman undressing herself made her appear more charming and embarrassed at each fresh article she took out. There was a Spanish blonde-lace cravat, thirty francs: she didn't want it, but the shopman had sworn it was the last, and that in future the price would be raised. Next came a Chantilly veil: rather dear, fifty francs; if she didn't wear it she could make it do for her daughter.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.153</span><span class="cts_passage">“Really, lace is so pretty!” repeated she with her nervous laugh. “Once I'm inside I could buy everything.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.154</span><span class="cts_passage">“And this?” asked Madame de Boves, taking up and examining a remnant of Maltese lace.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.155</span><span class="cts_passage">“That,” replied she, “is for an insertion. There are twenty-six yards--a franc the yard. Just fancy!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.156</span><span class="cts_passage">“But,” said Madame Bourdelais, surprised, “what are you going to do with it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.157</span><span class="cts_passage">“I'm sure I don't know. But it was such a funny pattern!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.158</span><span class="cts_passage">At this moment she raised her eyes and perceived her terrified husband in front of her. He had turned paler than usual, his whole person expressed the patient, resigned anguish of a man assisting, powerless, at the reckless expenditure of his salary, so dearly earned. Every fresh bit of lace was for him a disaster; bitter days of teaching swallowed up, long journeys to pupils through the mud devoured, the continued effort of his life resulting in a secret misery, the hell of a necessitous household. Before the increasing wildness of his look, she wanted to catch up the veil, the cravat, and the handkerchief, moving her feverish hands about, repeating with forced laughter: “You'll get me a scolding from my husband. I assure you, my dear, I've been very reasonable; for there was a fine piece of point at five hundred francs, oh! a marvel!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.159</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why didn't you buy it?” asked Madame Guibal, calmly. “Monsieur Marty is the most gallant of men.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.160</span><span class="cts_passage">The poor professor was obliged to bow and say his wife was perfectly welcome. But the idea of this point at five hundred francs was like a lump of ice dripping down his back; and as Mouret was just at that moment affirming that the new shops increased the comfort of the middle-class households, he glared at him with a terrible expression, the flash of hatred of a timid man who would have throttled him had he dared.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.161</span><span class="cts_passage">But the ladies had still kept hold of the bits of lace, fascinated, intoxicated. The pieces were unrolled, passed from one to the other, drawing the admirers closer still, holding them in the delicate meshes. On their laps there was a continual caress of this tissue, so miraculously fine, and amidst which their culpable fingers fondly lingered. They still kept Mouret a close prisoner, overwhelming him with fresh questions. As the day continued to decline, he was now and again obliged to bend his head, grazing their hair with his beard, to examine a stitch, or indicate a design. But in this soft voluptuousness of twilight, in the midst of this warm feminine atmosphere, Mouret still remained their master beneath the rapture he affected. He seemed, to be a woman himself, they felt themselves penetrated and overcome by this delicate sense of their secret that he possessed, and they abandoned themselves, captivated; whilst he, certain from that moment to have them at his mercy, appeared, brutally triumphing over them, the despotic monarch of dress.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.162</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, Monsieur Mouret!” stammered they, in low, hysterical voices, in the gloom of the drawing-room.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.163</span><span class="cts_passage">The last rays of the setting sun were dying away on the brass-work of the furniture. The laces alone retained a snowy reflex on the dark dresses of the ladies, of which the confused group seemed to surround the young man with a vague appearance of kneeling, worshipping women. A light still shone on the side of the silver teapot, a short flame like that of a night-light, burning in an alcove warmed by the perfume of the tea. But suddenly the servant entered with two lamps, and the charm was destroyed. The drawing-room became light and cheerful. Madame Marty was putting her lace in her little bag, Madame de Boves was eating a sponge cake, whilst Henriette who had got up, was talking in a half-whisper to the baron, near one of the windows.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.164</span><span class="cts_passage">“He's a charming fellow,” said the baron.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.165</span><span class="cts_passage">“Isn't he?” exclaimed she, with the involuntary cry of a woman in love.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.166</span><span class="cts_passage">He smiled, and looked at her with a paternal indulgence. This was the first time he had seen her so completely conquered; and, too proud to suffer from it, he experienced nothing but a feeling of compassion on seeing her in the hands of this handsome fellow, so tender and yet so cold-hearted. He thought he ought to warn her, and murmured in a joking tone: “Take care, my dear, or he'll eat you all up.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.167</span><span class="cts_passage">A flash of jealousy lighted up Henriette's eyes. Perhaps she understood Mouret had simply made use of her to get at the baron; and she determined to render him mad with passion, he whose hurried style of making love had the easy charm of a song thrown to the four winds of heaven. “Oh,” said she, affecting to joke in her turn, “the lamb always finishes up by eating the wolf.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.168</span><span class="cts_passage">The baron, greatly amused, encouraged, her with a nod. Could she be the woman who was to avenge all the others?</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.169</span><span class="cts_passage">When Mouret, after having reminded Vallagnosc that he wanted to show him his machine at work, came up to take his leave, the baron retained him near the window opposite the gardens, now buried in darkness. He yielded at last to the seduction; his confidence had come on seeing him in the midst of these ladies. Both conversed for a moment in a low tone, then the banker said: “Well, I'll look into the affair. It's settled if your Monday's sale proves as important as you expect.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.170</span><span class="cts_passage">They shook hands, and Mouret, delighted, took his leave, for he did not enjoy his dinner unless he went and gave a look at the day's receipts at The Ladies' Paradise.</span></div></div>
