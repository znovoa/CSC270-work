urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.1#CHAPTER I.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.2#DENISE had walked from the Saint-Lazare railway station, where a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.3#Cherbourg train had landed her and her two brothers, after a night
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.4#passed on the hard seat of a third-class carriage. She was leading Pépé
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.5#by the hand, and Jean was following her, all three fatigued after the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.6#journey, frightened and lost in this vast Paris, their eyes on every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.7#street name, asking at every corner the way to the Rue de la Michodière,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.8#where their uncle Baudu lived. But on arriving in the Place Gaillon, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.9#young girl stopped short, astonished.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.10#“Oh! look there, Jean,” said she; and they stood still, nestling close
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.11#to one another, all dressed in black, wearing the old mourning bought
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.12#at their father's death. She, rather puny for her twenty years, was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.13#carrying a small parcel; on the other side, her little brother, five
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.14#years old, was clinging to her arm; while behind her, the big brother, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.15#strapping youth of sixteen, was standing empty-handed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.16#“Well,” said she, after a pause, “that _is_ a shop!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.17#They were at the corner of the Rue de la Michodière and the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.18#Neuve-Saint-Augustin, in front of a draper's shop, which displayed a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.19#wealth of colour in the soft October light. Eight o'clock was striking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.20#at the church of Saint-Roch; not many people were about, only a few
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.21#clerks on their way to business, and housewives doing their morning
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.22#shopping. Before the door, two shopmen, mounted on a step-ladder,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.23#were hanging up some woollen goods, whilst in a window in the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.24#Neuve-Saint-Augustin another young man, kneeling with his back to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.25#pavement, was delicately plaiting a piece of blue silk. In the shop,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.26#where there were as yet no customers, there was a buzz as of a swarm of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.27#bees at work.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.28#“By Jove!” said Jean, “this beats Valognes. Yours wasn't such a fine
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.29#shop.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.30#Denise shook her head. She had spent two years there, at Cornaille's,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.31#the principal draper's in the town, and this shop, encountered so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.32#suddenly--this, to her, enormous place, made her heart swell, and kept
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.33#her excited, interested, and oblivious of everything else. The high
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.34#plate-glass door, facing the Place Gaillon, reached the first storey,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.35#amidst a complication of ornaments covered with gilding. Two allegorical
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.36#figures, representing two laughing, bare-breasted women, unrolled the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.37#scroll bearing the sign, “The Ladies' Paradise.” The establishment
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.38#extended along the Rue de la Michodière and the Rue Neuve-Saint
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.39#Augustin, and comprised, beside the corner house, four others--two on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.40#the right and two on the left, bought and fitted up recently. It seemed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.41#to her an endless extension, with its display on the ground floor, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.42#the plate-glass windows, through which could be seen the whole length of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.43#the counters. Upstairs a young lady, dressed all in silk, was sharpening
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.44#a pencil, while two others, beside her, were unfolding some velvet
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.45#mantles.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.46#“The Ladies' Paradise,” read Jean, with the tender laugh of a handsome
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.47#youth who had already had an adventure with a woman. “That must draw the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.48#customers--eh?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.49#But Denise was absorbed by the display at the principal entrance. There
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.50#she saw, in the open street, on the very pavement, a mountain of cheap
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.51#goods--bargains, placed there to tempt the passers-by, and attract
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.52#attention. Hanging from above were pieces of woollen and cloth goods,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.53#merinoes, cheviots, and tweeds, floating like flags; the neutral, slate,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.54#navy-blue, and olive-green tints being relieved by the large white
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.55#price-tickets. Close by, round the doorway, were hanging strips of fur,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.56#narrow bands for dress trimmings, fine Siberian squirrel-skin, spotless
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.57#snowy swansdown, rabbit-skin imitation ermine and imitation sable.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.58#Below, on shelves and on tables, amidst a pile of remnants, appeared an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.59#immense quantity of hosiery almost given away; knitted woollen gloves,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.60#neckerchiefs, women's hoods, waistcoats, a winter show in all colours,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.61#striped, dyed, and variegated, with here and there a flaming patch of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.62#red. Denise saw some tartan at nine sous, some strips of American vison
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.63#at a franc, and some mittens at five sous. There appeared to be an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.64#immense clearance sale going on; the establishment seemed bursting with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.65#goods, blocking up the pavement with the surplus.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.66#Uncle Baudu was forgotten. Pépé himself, clinging tightly to his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.67#sister's hand, opened his big eyes in wonder. A vehicle coming
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.68#up, forced them to quit the road-way, and they turned up the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.69#Neuve-Saint-Augustin mechanically, following the shop windows and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.70#stopping at each fresh display. At first they were captivated by a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.71#complicated arrangement: above, a number of umbrellas, laid obliquely,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.72#seemed to form a rustic roof; beneath these a quantity of silk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.73#stockings, hung on rods, showed the roundness of the calves, some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.74#covered with rosebuds, others of all colours, black open-worked, red
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.75#with embroidered corners, and flesh colour, the silky grain of which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.76#made them look as soft as a fair woman's skin; and at the bottom of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.77#all, a symmetrical array of gloves, with their taper fingers and narrow
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.78#palms, and that rigid virgin grace which characterises such feminine
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.79#articles before they are worn. But the last window especially attracted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.80#their attention. It was an exhibition of silks, satins, and velvets,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.81#arranged so as to produce, by a skilful artistic arrangement of colours,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.82#the most delicious shades imaginable. At the top were the velvets,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.83#from a deep black to a milky white: lower down, the satins--pink, blue,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.84#fading away into shades of a wondrous delicacy; still lower down were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.85#the silks, of all the colours of the rainbow, pieces set up in the form
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.86#of shells, others folded as if round a pretty figure, arranged in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.87#life-like natural manner by the clever fingers of the window dressers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.88#Between each motive, between each coloured phrase of the display, ran a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.89#discreet accompaniment, a slight puffy ring of cream-coloured silk. At
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.90#each end were piled up enormous bales of the silk of which the house
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.91#had made a specialty, the “Paris Paradise” and the “Golden Grain,” two
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.92#exceptional articles destined to work a revolution in that branch of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.93#commerce.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.94#“Oh, that silk at five francs twelve sous!” murmured Denise, astonished
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.95#at the “Paris Paradise.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.96#Jean began to get tired. He stopped a passer-by. “Which is the Rue de la
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.97#Michodiere, please, sir?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.98#On hearing that it was the first on the right they all turned back,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.99#making the tour of the establishment. But just as she was entering the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.100#street, Denise was attracted by a window in which ladies' dresses were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.101#displayed. At Cornaille's that was her department, but she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.102#never seen anything like this, and remained rooted to the spot with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.103#admiration. At the back a large sash of Bruges lace, of considerable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.104#value, was spread out like an altar-veil, with its two white wings
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.105#extended; there were flounces of Alençon point, grouped in garlands;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.106#then from the top to the bottom fluttered, like a fall of snow, a cloud
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.107#of lace of every description--Malines, Honiton, Valenciennes, Brussels,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.108#and Venetian-point. On each side the heavy columns were draped with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.109#cloth, making the background appear still more distant And the dresses
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.110#were in this sort of chapel raised to the worship of woman's beauty and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.111#grace. Occupying the centre was a magnificent article, a velvet mantle,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.112#trimmed with silver fox; on one side a silk cape lined with miniver, on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.113#the other a cloth cloak edged with cocks' plumes; and last of all,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.114#opera cloaks in white cashmere and white silk trimmed with swansdown or
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.115#chenille. There was something for all tastes, from the opera cloaks at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.116#twenty-nine francs to the velvet mantle marked up at eighteen hundred.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.117#The well-rounded neck and graceful figures of the dummies exaggerated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.118#the slimness of the waist, the absent head being replaced by a large
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.119#price-ticket pinned on the neck; whilst the mirrors, cleverly arranged
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.120#on each side of the window, reflected and multiplied the forms without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.121#end, peopling the street with these beautiful women for sale, each
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.122#bearing a price in big figures in the place of a head.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.123#“How stunning they are!” murmured Jean, finding no other words to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.124#express his emotion.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.125#This time he himself had become motionless, his mouth open. All this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.126#female luxury turned him rosy with pleasure. He had a girl's beauty--a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.127#beauty he seemed to have stolen from his sister--a lovely skin, curly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.128#hair, lips and eyes overflowing with tenderness. By his side Denise, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.129#her astonishment, appeared thinner still, with her rather long face and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.130#large mouth, fading complexion, and light hair. Pépé, also fair, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.131#way of most children, clung closer to her, as if wanting to be caressed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.132#troubled and delighted at the sight of the beautiful ladies in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.133#window. They looked so strange, so charming, on the pavement, those
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.134#three fair ones, poorly dressed in black--the sad-looking young girl
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.135#between the pretty child and the handsome youth--that the passers-by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.136#looked back smilingly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.137#For several minutes a stout man with grey hair and a large yellow
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.138#face, standing at a shop-door on the other side of the street, had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.139#been looking at them. He was standing there with bloodshot eyes and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.140#contracted mouth, beside himself with rage at the display made by The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.141#Ladies' Paradise, when the sight of the young girl and her brothers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.142#completed his exasperation. What were those three simpletons doing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.143#there, gaping in front of the cheap-jack's parade?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.144#“What about uncle?” asked Denise, suddenly, as if just waking up.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.145#“We are in the Rue de la Michodière,” said Jean. “He must live somewhere
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.146#about here.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.147#They raised their heads and looked round. Just in front of them, above
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.148#the stout man, they perceived a green sign-board bearing in yellow
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.149#letters, discoloured by the rain: “The Old Elbeuf. Cloths, Flannels.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.150#Baudu, late Hauchecorne.” The house, coated with an ancient rusty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.151#white-wash, quite flat and unadorned, amidst the mansions in the Louis
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.152#XIV. style which surrounded it, had only three front windows, and these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.153#windows, square, without shutters, were simply ornamented by a handrail
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.154#and two iron bars in the form of a cross. But amidst all this nudity,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.155#what struck Denise the most, her eyes full of the light airy windows at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.156#The Ladies' Paradise, was the ground-floor shop, crushed by the ceiling,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.157#surmounted by a very low storey with half-moon windows, of a prison-like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.158#appearance. The wainscoting, of a bottle-green hue, which time had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.159#tinted with ochre and bitumen, encircled, right and left, two deep
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.160#windows, black and dusty, in which the heaped-up goods could hardly be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.161#seen. The open door seemed to lead into the darkness and dampness of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.162#cellar.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.163#[Illustration: 0021]
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.164#“That's the house,” said Jean.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.165#“Well, we must go in,” declared Denise. “Come on, Pepé.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.166#They appeared, however, somewhat troubled, as if seized with fear. When
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.167#their father died, carried off by the same fever which had, a month
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.168#previous, killed their mother, their uncle Baudu, in the emotion which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.169#followed this double mourning, had written to Denise, assuring her there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.170#would always be a place for her in his house whenever she would like to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.171#come to Paris. But this was nearly a year ago, and the young girl was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.172#now sorry to have left Valognes in a moment of temper without informing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.173#her uncle. The latter did not know them, never having set foot in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.174#Valognes since the day he left, as a boy, to enter as junior in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.175#drapery establishment kept by Hauchecorne, whose daughter he afterwards
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.176#married.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.177#“Monsieur Baudu?” asked Denise, deciding at last to speak to the stout
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.178#man who was still eyeing them, surprised at their appearance.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.179#“That's me,” replied he.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.180#Denise blushed and stammered out: “Oh, I'm so pleased! I am Denise. This
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.181#is Jean, and this is Pépé. You see we have come, uncle.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.182#Baudu seemed amazed. His big eyes rolled in his yellow face; he spoke
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.183#slowly and with difficulty. He was evidently far from thinking of this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.184#family which suddenly dropped down on him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.185#“What--what, you here?” repeated he several times. “But you were at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.186#Valognes. Why aren't you at Valognes?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.187#With her sweet but rather faltering voice she then explained that since
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.188#the death of her father, who had spent everything in his dye-works, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.189#had acted as a mother to the two children, but the little she earned at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.190#Cornaille's did not suffice to keep the three of them. Jeàn worked at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.191#a cabinetmaker's, a repairer of old furniture, but didn't earn a sou.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.192#However, he had got to like the business, and had learned to carve
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.193#in wood very well. One day, having found a piece of ivory, he amused
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.194#himself by carving a head, which a gentleman staying in the town had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.195#seen and admired, and it was this gentleman who had persuaded them to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.196#leave Valognes, promising to find a place in Paris for Jean with an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.197#ivory-carver.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.198#“So you see, uncle,” continued Denise, “Jean will commence his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.199#apprenticeship at his new master's to-morrow. They ask no premium, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.200#will board and lodge him. I felt sure Pépé and I could manage very well.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.201#We can't be worse off than we were at Valognes.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.202#She said nothing about Jean's love affair, of certain letters written to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.203#the daughter of a nobleman living in the town, of kisses exchanged over
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.204#a wall--in fact, quite a scandal which had determined her leaving. And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.205#she was especially anxious to be in Paris, to be able to look after
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.206#her brother, feeling quite a mother's tender anxiety for this gay and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.207#handsome youth, whom all the women adored. Uncle Baudu couldn't get over
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.208#it, and continued his questions. However, when he heard her speaking of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.209#her brothers in this way he became much kinder.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.210#“So your father has left you nothing,” said he. “I certainly thought
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.211#there was still something left. Ah! how many times did I write advising
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.212#him not to take that dye-work! A good-hearted fellow, but no head for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.213#business! And you've been obliged to keep and look after these two
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.214#youngsters since?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.215#His bilious face had become clearer, his eyes were not so bloodshot as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.216#when he was glaring at The Ladies' Paradise. Suddenly he noticed that he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.217#was blocking up the doorway.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.218#“Well,” said he, “come in, now you're here. Come in, no use hanging
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.219#about gaping at a parcel of rubbish.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.220#And after having darted a last look of anger at The Ladies' Paradise, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.221#made way for the children by entering the shop and calling his wife and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.222#daughter. .
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.223#“Elizabeth, Geneviève, come down; here's company for you!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.224#But Denise and the two boys hesitated before the darkness of the shop.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.225#Blinded by the clear light of the street, they could hardly see. Feeling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.226#their way with their feet with an instinctive fear of encountering some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.227#treacherous step, and clinging still closer together from this vague
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.228#fear, the child continuing to hold the young girl's skirts, and the big
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.229#boy behind, they made their entry with a smiling, anxious grace.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.230#The clear morning light described the dark profile of their mourning
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.231#clothes; an oblique ray of sunshine gilded their fair hair.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.232#“Come in, come in,” repeated Baudu.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.233#In a few brief sentences he explained the matter to his wife and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.234#daughter. The first was a little woman, eaten up with anaemia, quite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.235#white--white hair, white eyes, white lips. Geneviève, in whom her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.236#mother's degenerateness appeared stronger still, had the debilitated,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.237#colourless appearance of a plant reared in the shade. However, her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.238#magnificent black hair, thick and heavy, marvellously vigorous for such
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.239#a weak, poor soil, gave her a sad charm.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.240#“Come in,” said both the women in their turn; “you are welcome.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.241#And they made Denise sit down behind a counter. Pépé immediately jumped
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.242#up on his sister's lap, whilst Jean leant against some wood-work beside
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.243#her. Looking round the shop the new-comers began to take courage, their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.244#eyes getting used to the obscurity. Now they could see it, with its low
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.245#and smoky ceiling, oaken counters bright with use, and old-fashioned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.246#drawers with strong iron fittings. Bales of goods reached to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.247#beams above; the smell of linen and dyed stuffs--a sharp chemical
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.248#smell--seemed intensified by the humidity of the floor. At the further
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.249#end two young men and a young woman were putting away pieces of white
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.250#flannel.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.251#“Perhaps this young gentleman would like to take something?” said Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.252#Baudu, smiling at Pépé.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.253#“No, thanks,” replied Denise, “we had a cup of milk in a café opposite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.254#the station.” And as Geneviève looked at the small parcel she had laid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.255#down, she added: “I left our box there too.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.256#She blushed, feeling that she ought not to have dropped down on her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.257#friends in this way. Even as she was leaving Valognes, she had been full
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.258#of regrets and fears; that was why she had left the box, and given the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.259#children their breakfast.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.260#“Come, come,” said Baudu suddenly, “let's come to an understanding.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.261#'Tis true I wrote to you, but that's a year ago, and since then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.262#business hasn't been flourishing, I can assure you, my girl.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.263#He stopped, choked with an emotion he did not wish to show. Madame Baudu
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.264#and Geneviève, with a resigned look, had cast their eyes down.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.265#“Oh,” continued he, “it's a crisis which will pass, no doubt, but I have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.266#reduced my staff; there are only three here now, and this is not the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.267#moment to engage a fourth. In short, my dear girl, I cannot take you as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.268#I promised.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.269#Denise listened, and turned very pale. He dwelt upon the subject,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.270#adding: “It would do no good, either to you or to me.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.271#“All right, uncle,” replied she with a painful effort, “I'll try and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.272#manage all the same.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.273#The Baudus were not bad sort of people. But they complained of never
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.274#having had any luck. When their business was flourishing, they had had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.275#to bring up five sons, of whom three had died before attaining the age
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.276#of twenty; the fourth had gone wrong, and the fifth had just left for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.277#Mexico, as a captain. Genevieve was the only one left at home. But this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.278#large family had cost a great deal of money, and Baudu had made things
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.279#worse by buying a great lumbering country house, at Rambouillet, near
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.280#his wife's father's place. Thus, a sharp, sour feeling was springing up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.281#in the honest old tradesman's breast.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.282#“You might have warned us,” resumed he, gradually getting angry at his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.283#own harshness. “You could have written; I should have told you to stay
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.284#at Valognes. When I heard of your father's death I said what is right on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.285#such occasions, but you drop down on us without a word of warning. It's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.286#very awkward.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.287#He raised his voice, and that relieved him. His wife and daughter still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.288#kept their eyes on the ground, like submissive persons who would never
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.289#think of interfering. However, whilst Jean had turned pale, Denise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.290#had hugged the terrified Pépé to her bosom. She dropped hot tears of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.291#disappointment.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.292#“All right, uncle,” she said, “we'll go away.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.293#At that he stopped, an awkward silence ensued. Then he resumed in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.294#harsh tone: “I don't mean to turn you out. As you are here you must stay
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.295#the night; to-morrow we will see.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.296#Then Madame Baudu and Genevieve understood they were free to arrange
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.297#matters. There was no need to trouble about Jean, as he was to commence
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.298#his apprenticeship the next day. As for Pépé, he would be well looked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.299#after by Madame Gras, an old lady living in the Rue des Orties, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.300#boarded and lodged young children for forty francs a month. Denise said
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.301#she had sufficient to pay for the first month, and as for herself they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.302#could soon find her a situation in the neighbourhood, no doubt.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.303#“Wasn't Vinçard wanting a saleswoman?” asked Genevieve.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.304#“Of course!” cried Baudu; “we'll go and see him after lunch. Nothing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.305#like striking the iron while it's hot.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.306#Not a customer had been in to interrupt this family discussion; the shop
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.307#remained dark and empty. At the other end, the two young men and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.308#young women were still working, talking in a low hissing tone amongst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.309#themselves. However, three ladies arrived, and Denise was left alone for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.310#a moment. She kissed Pépé with a swelling heart, at the thought of their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.311#approaching separation. The child, affectionate as a kitten, hid his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.312#head without saying a word. When Madame Baudu and Geneviève returned,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.313#they remarked how quiet he was. Denise assured them he never made any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.314#more noise than that, remaining for days together without speaking,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.315#living on kisses and caresses. Until lunch-time the three women sat
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.316#and talked about children, housekeeping, life in Paris and life in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.317#the country, in short, vague sentences, like relations feeling rather
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.318#awkward through not knowing one another very well. Jean had gone to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.319#shop-door, and stood there watching the passing crowd and smiling at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.320#pretty girls. At ten o'clock a servant appeared. As a rule the cloth was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.321#laid for Baudu, Genevieve, and the first-hand. A second lunch was served
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.322#at eleven o'clock for Madame Baudu, the other young man, and the young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.323#woman.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.324#“Come to lunch!” called out the draper, turning towards his niece. .
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.325#And as all sat ready in the narrow dining-room behind the shop, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.326#called the first-hand who had not come.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.327#“Colomban!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.328#The young man apologised, having wished to finish arranging the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.329#flannels. He was a big, stout fellow of twenty-five, heavy and freckled,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.330#with an honest face, large weak mouth, and cunning eyes.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.331#“There's a time for everything,” said Baudu, solidly seated before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.332#a piece of cold veal, which he was carving with a master's skill and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.333#prudence, weighing each piece at a glance to within an ounce.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.334#He served everybody, and even cut up the bread. Denise had placed Pépé
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.335#near her to see that he ate properly. But the dark close room made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.336#her feel uncomfortable. She thought it so small, after the large
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.337#well-lighted rooms she had been accustomed to in the country. A single
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.338#window opened on a small back-yard, which communicated with the street
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.339#by a dark alley along the side of the house. And this yard, sodden and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.340#filthy, was like the bottom of a well into which a glimmer of light had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.341#fallen. In the winter they were obliged to keep the gas burning all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.342#day long. When the weather enabled them to do without gas it was duller
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.343#still. Denise was several seconds before her eyes got sufficiently used
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.344#to the light to distinguish the food on her plate.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.345#“That young chap has a good appetite,” remarked Baudu, observing that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.346#Jean had finished his veal. “If he works as well as he eats, he'll make
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.347#a fine fellow. But you, my girl, you don't eat. And, I say, now we can
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.348#talk a bit, tell us why you didn't get married at Valognes?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.349#Denise almost dropped the glass she had in her hand. “Oh! uncle--get
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.350#married! How can you think of it? And the little ones!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.351#She was forced to laugh, it seemed to her such a strange idea. Besides,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.352#what man would care to have her--a girl without a sou, no fatter than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.353#a lath, and not at all pretty? No, no, she would never marry, she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.354#quite enough children with her two brothers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.355#“You are wrong,” said her uncle; “a woman always needs a man. If you had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.356#found an honest young fellow, you wouldn't have dropped on to the Paris
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.357#pavement, you and your brothers, like a family of gipsies.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.358#He stopped, to divide with a parsimony full of justice, a dish of bacon
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.359#and potatoes which the servant brought in. Then, pointing to Geneviève
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.360#and Colomban with his spoon, he added: “Those two will be married next
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.361#spring, if we have a good winter season.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.362#Such was the patriarchal custom of the house. The founder, Aristide
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.363#Finet, had given his daughter, Désirée to his firsthand, Hauchecorne;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.364#he, Baudu, who had arrived in the Rue de la Michodière with seven francs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.365#in his pocket, had married old Hauchecorne's daughter, Elizabeth; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.366#he intended, in his turn, to hand over Geneviève and the business to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.367#Colomban as soon as trade should improve. If he thus delayed a marriage,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.368#decided on for three years past, it was by a scruple, an obstinate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.369#probity. He had received the business in a prosperous state, and did
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.370#not wish to pass it on to his son-in-law less patronised or in a worse
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.371#position than when he took it. Baudu continued, introducing Colomban,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.372#who came from Rambouillet, the same place as Madame Baudu's father; in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.373#fact they were distant cousins. A hard-working fellow, who for ten years
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.374#had slaved in the shop, fairly earning his promotions! Besides, he was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.375#far from being a nobody; he had for father that noted toper, Colomban,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.376#a veterinary surgeon, known all over the department of Seine-et-Oise, an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.377#artist in his line, but so fond of the flowing bowl that he was ruining
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.378#himself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.379#“Thank heaven!” said the draper in conclusion, “if the father drinks and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.380#runs after the women, the son has learnt the value of money here.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.381#Whilst he was speaking Denise was examining Genevieve and Colomban. They
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.382#sat close together at table, but remained very quiet, without a blush
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.383#or a smile. From the day of his entry the young man had counted on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.384#this marriage. He had passed through the various stages: junior,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.385#counter-hand, etc., and had at last gained admittance into the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.386#confidence and pleasures of the family circle, all this patiently, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.387#leading a clock-work style of life, looking upon this marriage with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.388#Geneviève as an excellent, convenient arrangement. The certainty of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.389#having her prevented him feeling any desire for her. And the young girl
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.390#had also got to love him, but with the gravity of her reserved nature,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.391#and a real deep passion of which she herself was not aware, in her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.392#regular, monotonous daily life.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.393#“Quite right, if they like each other, and can do it,” said Denise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.394#smiling, considering it her duty to make herself agreeable.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.395#“Yes, it always finishes like that,” declared Colomban, who had not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.396#spoken a word before, masticating slowly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.397#Geneviève, after giving him a long look, said in her turn: “When people
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.398#understand each other, the rest comes naturally.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.399#Their tenderness had sprung up in this gloomy house of old Paris like a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.400#flower in a cellar. For ten years she had known no one but him, living
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.401#by his side, behind the same bales of cloth, amidst the darkness of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.402#shop; morning and evening they found themselves elbow to elbow in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.403#narrow dining-room, so damp and dull. They could not have been more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.404#concealed, more utterly lost had they been in the country, in the woods.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.405#But a doubt, a jealous fear, began to suggest itself to the young girl,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.406#that she had given her hand, for ever, amidst this abetting solitude
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.407#through sheer emptiness of heart and mental weariness.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.408#However, Denise, having remarked a growing anxiety in the look Geneviève
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.409#cast at Colomban, good-naturedly replied: “Oh! when people are in love
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.410#they always understand each other.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.411#But Baudu kept a sharp eye on the table. He had distributed slices of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.412#Brie cheese, and, as a treat for the visitors, he called for a second
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.413#dessert, a pot of red-currant jam, a liberality which seemed to surprise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.414#Colomban. Pépé, who up to then had been very good, behaved rather
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.415#badly at the sight of the jam; whilst Jean, all attention during the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.416#conversation about Genevieve's marriage, was taking stock of the latter,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.417#whom he thought too weak, too pale, comparing her in his own mind to a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.418#little white rabbit with black ears and pink eyes.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.419#“We've chatted enough, and must now make room for the others,” said the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.420#draper, giving the signal to rise from table. “Just because we've had a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.421#treat is no reason why we should want too much of it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.422#Madame Baudu, the other shopman, and the young lady then came and took
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.423#their places at the table. Denise, left alone again, sat near the door
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.424#waiting for her uncle to take her to Vinçard's.. Pépé was playing at her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.425#feet, whilst Jean had resumed his post of observation at the door. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.426#sat there for nearly an hour, taking an interest in what was going on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.427#around her. Now and again a few customers came in; a lady, then two
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.428#others appeared, the shop retaining its musty odour, its half light, by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.429#which the old-fashioned business, good-natured and simple, seemed to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.430#be weeping at its desertion. But what most interested Denise was The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.431#Ladies' Paradise opposite, the windows of which she could see through
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.432#the open door. The sky remained clouded, a sort of humid softness warmed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.433#the air, notwithstanding the season; and in this clear light, in which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.434#there was, as it were, a hazy diffusion of sunshine, the great shop
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.435#seemed alive and in full activity.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.436#Denise began to feel as if she were watching a machine working at full
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.437#pressure, communicating its movement even as far as the windows. They
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.438#were no longer the cold windows she had seen in the early morning; they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.439#seemed to be warm and vibrating from the activity within. There was a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.440#crowd before them, groups of women pushing and squeezing, devouring the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.441#finery with longing, covetous eyes. And the stuffs became animated in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.442#this passionate atmosphere: the laces fluttered, drooped, and concealed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.443#the depths of the shop with a troubling air of mystery; even the lengths
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.444#of cloth, thick and heavy, exhaled a tempting odour, while the cloaks
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.445#threw out their folds over the dummies, which assumed a soul, and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.446#great velvet mantle particularly, expanded, supple and warm, as if on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.447#real fleshly shoulders, with a heaving of the bosom and a trembling of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.448#the hips. But the furnace-like glow which the house exhaled came above
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.449#all from the sale, the crush at the counters, that could be felt behind
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.450#the walls. There was the continual roaring of the machine at work, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.451#marshalling of the customers, bewildered amidst the piles of goods, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.452#finally pushed along to the pay-desk. And all that went on in an orderly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.453#manner, with mechanical regularity, quite a nation of women passing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.454#through the force and logic of this wonderful commercial machine.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.455#Denise had felt herself being tempted all day. She was bewildered and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.456#attracted by this shop, to her so vast, in which she saw more people in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.457#an hour than she had seen at Cornaille's in six months; and there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.458#was mingled with her desire to enter it a vague sense of danger which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.459#rendered the seduction complete. At the same time her uncle's shop made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.460#her feel ill at ease; she felt an unreasonable disdain, an instinctive
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.461#repugnance for this cold, icy place, the home of old-fashioned trading.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.462#All her sensations--her anxious entry, her friends' cold reception, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.463#dull lunch eaten in a prison-like atmosphere, her waiting amidst the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.464#sleepy solitude of this old house doomed to a speedy decay--all these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.465#sensations reproduced themselves in her mind under the form of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.466#dumb protestation, a passionate longing for life and light. And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.467#notwithstanding her really tender heart, her eyes turned to The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.468#Paradise, as if the saleswoman within her felt the need to go and warm
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.469#herself at the glow of this immense business.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.470#“Plenty of customers over there!” was the remark that escaped her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.471#But she regretted her words on seeing the Baudus near her. Madame Baudu,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.472#who had finished her lunch, was standing up, quite white, with her pale
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.473#eyes fixed on the monster; every time she caught sight of this place, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.474#mute, blank despair swelled her heart, and filled her eyes with scalding
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.475#tears. As for Geneviève, she was anxiously watching Colomban, who,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.476#not supposing he was being observed, stood in ecstasy, looking at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.477#handsome young saleswomen in the dress department opposite, the counter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.478#being visible through the first floor window. Baudu, his anger rising,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.479#merely said:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.480#“All is not gold that glitters. Patience!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.481#The thought of his family evidently kept back the flood of rancour which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.482#was rising in his throat A feeling of pride prevented him displaying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.483#his temper before these children, only that morning arrived. At last the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.484#draper made an effort, and tore himself away from the spectacle of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.485#sale opposite.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.486#“Well!” resumed he, “we'll go and see Vinçard. These situations are soon
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.487#snatched up; it might be too late tomorrow.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.488#But before going out he ordered the junior to go to the station and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.489#fetch Denise's box. Madame. Baudu, to whom the young girl had confided
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.490#Pépé, decided to run over and see Madame Gras, to arrange about the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.491#child. Jean promised his sister not to stir from the shop.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.492#“It's two minutes' walk,” explained Baudu as they went down the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.493#Gaillon; “Vinçard has a silk business, and still does a fair trade. Of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.494#course he suffers, like every one else, but he's an artful fellow, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.495#makes both ends meet by his miserly ways. I fancy, though, he wants to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.496#retire, on account of his rheumatics.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.497#The shop was in the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs, near, the Passage
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.498#Choiseul. It was clean and light, well fitted up in the modern style,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.499#but rather small, and contained but a poor stock. They found Vinçard in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.500#consultation with two gentlemen.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.501#“Never mind us,” called out the draper; “we are in no hurry; we can
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.502#wait.” And returning to the door he whispered to Denise: “The thin
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.503#fellow is at The Paradise, second in the silk department, and the stout
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.504#man is a silk manufacturer from Lyons.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.505#Denise gathered that Vinçard was trying to sell his business to Robineau
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.506#of The Paradise. He was giving his word of honour in a frank open way,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.507#with the facility of a man who could take any number of oaths without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.508#the slightest trouble. According to his account, the business was a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.509#golden one; and in the splendour of his rude health he interrupted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.510#himself to whine and complain of those infernal pains which prevented
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.511#him stopping and making his fortune. But Robineau, nervous and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.512#tormented, interrupted him impatiently. He knew what a crisis the trade
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.513#was passing through, and named a silk warehouse already ruined by The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.514#Paradise. Vinçard, inflamed, raised his voice.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.515#“No wonder! The fall of that great booby of a Vabre was certain. His
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.516#wife spent everything he earned. Besides, we are more than five hundred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.517#yards away, whilst Vabre was almost next door to The Paradise.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.518#Gaujean, the silk manufacturer, then chimed in, and their voices fell
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.519#again. He accused the big establishments of ruining French manufacture;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.520#three or four laid down the law, reigning like masters over the market;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.521#and he gave it as his opinion that the only way of fighting them was to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.522#favour the small traders; above all, those who dealt in special classes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.523#of goods, to whom the future belonged. Therefore he offered Robineau
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.524#plenty of credit.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.525#“See how you have been treated at The Paradise,” said he. “No notice
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.526#taken of your long service. You had the promise of the first-hand's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.527#place long ago, when Bouthemont, an outsider without any claim, came in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.528#and got it at once.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.529#Robineau was still smarting under this injustice. However, he hesitated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.530#to start on his own account, explaining that the money came from his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.531#wife, a legacy of sixty thousand francs she had just inherited, and he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.532#was full of scruples regarding this sum, saying that he would rather cut
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.533#off his right hand than compromise her money in a doubtful affair.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.534#“No,” said he, “I haven't made up my mind; give me time to think over
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.535#it. We'll have another talk about it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.536#“As you like,” replied Vinçard, concealing his disappointment under a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.537#smiling countenance. “It's to my interest not to sell; and were it not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.538#for my rheumatics----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.539#And returning to the middle of the shop, he asked: “What can I do for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.540#you, Monsieur Baudu?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.541#The draper, who had been listening with one ear, introduced Denise, told
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.542#him as much as he thought necessary of her story, adding that she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.543#two years' country experience.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.544#“And as I have heard you are wanting a good saleswoman----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.545#Vinçard affected to be awfully sorry. “What an unfortunate thing!” said
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.546#he. “I have, indeed, been looking for a saleswoman all the week; but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.547#I've just engaged one--not two hours ago.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.548#A silence ensued. Denise seemed disheartened. Robineau, who was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.549#looking at her with interest, probably inspired with pity by her poor
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.550#appearance, ventured to say:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.551#“I know they're wanting a young person at our place, in the ready-made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.552#dress department.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.553#Baudu could not help crying out fervently: “At your place? Never!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.554#Then he stopped, embarrassed. Denise had turned very red; she would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.555#never dare enter that great place, and yet the idea of being there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.556#filled her with pride.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.557#“Why not?” asked Robineau, surprised. “It would be a good opening
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.558#for the young lady. I advise her to go and see Madame. Aurélie, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.559#first-hand, to-morrow. The worst that can happen to her is not to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.560#accepted.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.561#The draper, to conceal his inward revolt, began to talk vaguely. He knew
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.562#Madame Aurélie, or, at least, her husband, Lhomme, the cashier, a stout
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.563#man, who had had his right arm severed by an omnibus. Then turning
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.564#suddenly to Denise, he added: “However, that's her business. She can do
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.565#as she likes.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.566#And he went out, after having said “good-day” to Gaujean and Robineau.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.567#Vinçard went with him as far as the door, reiterating his regrets. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.568#young girl had remained in the middle of the shop, intimidated, desirous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.569#of asking Robineau for further particulars. But not daring to, she in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.570#her turn bowed, and simply said: “Thank you, sir.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.571#On the way back Baudu said nothing to his niece, but walked very fast,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.572#forcing her to run to keep up with him, as if carried away by his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.573#reflections. Arrived in the Rue de la Michodière, he was going into his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.574#shop, when a neighbouring shopkeeper, standing at his door, called him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.575#Denise stopped and waited.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.576#“What is it, old Bourras?” asked the draper.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.577#Bourras was a tall old man, with a prophet's head, bearded and hairy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.578#and piercing eyes under thick and bushy eyebrows. He kept an umbrella
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.579#and walking-stick shop, did repairs, and even carved handles, which had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.580#won for him an artistic celebrity in the neighbourhood. Denise glanced
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.581#at the shop-window, where the umbrellas and sticks were arranged in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.582#straight lines. But on raising her eyes she was astonished at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.583#appearance of the house, a hovel squeezed between The Ladies' Paradise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.584#and a large building of the Louis XIV. style, sprung up one hardly knew
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.585#how, in this narrow space, crushed by its two low storeys. Had it not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.586#been for the support on each side it must have fallen; the slates were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.587#old and rotten, and the two-windowed front was cracked and covered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.588#with stains, which ran down in long rusty lines over the worm-eaten
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.589#sign-board.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.590#“You know he's written to my landlord, offering to buy the house?” said
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.591#Bourras, looking steadily at the draper with his fiery eyes.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.592#Baudu became paler still, and bent his shoulders. There was a silence,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.593#during which the two men remained face to face, looking very serious.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.594#“Must be prepared for anything now,” murmured Baudu at last.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.595#Bourras then got angry, shaking his hair and flowing board. “Let him buy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.596#the house, he'll have to pay four times the value for it! But I swear
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.597#that as long as I live he shall not touch a stone of it. My lease has
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.598#twelve years to run yet. We shall see! we shall see!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.599#It was a declaration of war. Bourras looked towards The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.600#Paradise, which neither had directly named. Baudu shook his head in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.601#silence, and then crossed the street to his shop, his legs almost
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.602#failing under him. “Ah! good Lord! ah! good Lord!” he kept repeating.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.603#Denise, who had heard all, followed her uncle. Madame Baudu had just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.604#come back with Pépé, whom Madame Gras had agreed to receive at anytime.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.605#But Jean had disappeared, and this made his sister anxious. When
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.606#he returned with a flushed face, talking in an animated way of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.607#boulevards, she looked at him with such a sad expression that he blushed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.608#with shame. The box had arrived, and it was arranged that they should
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.609#sleep in the attic.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.610#“How did you get on at Vinçard's?” asked Madame Baudu, suddenly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.611#The draper related his useless errand, adding that Denise had heard of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.612#a situation; and, pointing to The Ladies' Paradise with a scornful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.613#gesture, he cried out: “There--in there!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.614#The whole family felt wounded at the idea. The first dinner was at five
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.615#o'clock. Denise and the two children took their places, with Baudu,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.616#Geneviève, and Colomban. A single jet of gas lighted and warmed the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.617#little dining-room, reeking with the smell of hot food. The meal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.618#passed off in silence, but at dessert Madame Baudu, who could not rest
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.619#anywhere, left the shop, and came and sat down near Denise. And then the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.620#storm, kept back all day, broke out, every one feeling a certain relief
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.621#in abusing the monster.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.622#“It's your business, you can do as you like,” repeated Baudu. “We
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.623#don't want to influence you. But if you only knew what sort of place it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.624#is----” And he commenced to relate, in broken sentences, the history of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.625#this Octave Mouret. Wonderful luck! A fellow who had come up from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.626#South of France with the amiable audacity of an adventurer; no sooner
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.627#arrived than he commenced to distinguish himself by all sorts of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.628#disgraceful pranks with the ladies; had figured in an affair, which was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.629#still the talk of the neighbourhood; and to crown all, had suddenly and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.630#mysteriously made the conquest of Madame Hédouin, who brought him The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.631#Ladies' Paradise as a marriage portion.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.632#“Poor Caroline!” interrupted Madame Baudu. “We were distantly related.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.633#If she had lived things would be different. She wouldn't have let them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.634#ruin us like this. And he's the man who killed her. Yes, that very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.635#building! One morning, when visiting the works, she fell down a hole,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.636#and three days after she died. A fine, strong, healthy woman, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.637#had never known what illness was! There's some of her blood in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.638#foundation of that house.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.639#She pointed to the establishment opposite with her pale and trembling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.640#hand. Denise, listening as to a fairy tale, slightly shuddered; the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.641#sense of fear which had mingled with the temptation she had felt since
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.642#the morning, was caused perhaps by the presence of this woman's blood,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.643#which she fancied she could see in the red mortar of the basement.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.644#“It seems as if it brought him good luck,” added Madame Baudu, without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.645#mentioning Mouret by name.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.646#But the draper shrugged his shoulders, disdaining these old women's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.647#tales, and resumed his story, explaining the situation commercially. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.648#Ladies' Paradise was founded in 1822 by two brothers, named Deleuze.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.649#On the death of the elder, his daughter, Caroline, married the son of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.650#a linen manufacturer, Charles Hédouin; and, later on, becoming a widow,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.651#she married Mouret. She thus brought him a half share of the business.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.652#Three months after the marriage, the second brother Deleuze died
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.653#childless; so that when Caroline met her death, Mouret became sole heir,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.654#sole proprietor of The Ladies' Paradise. Wonderful luck!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.655#“A sharp fellow, a dangerous busybody, who will overthrow the whole
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.656#neighborhood if allowed to!” continued Baudu. “I fancy that Caroline,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.657#a rather romantic woman, must have been carried away by the gentleman's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.658#extravagant ideas. In short, he persuaded her to buy the house on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.659#left, then the one on the right; and he himself, on becoming his own
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.660#master, bought two others; so that the establishment has continued to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.661#grow--extending in such a way that it now threatens to swallow us all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.662#up!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.663#He was addressing Denise, but was really speaking more to himself,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.664#feeling a feverish longing to go over this history which haunted him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.665#continually. At home he was always angry, always violent, clenching
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.666#his fists as if longing to go for somebody. Madame Baudu ceased to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.667#interfere, sitting motionless on her chair; Genevieve and Colomban,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.668#their eyes cast down, were picking up and eating the crumbs off the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.669#table, just for the sake of something to do. It was so warm, so stuffy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.670#in the small room, that Pépé was sleeping with his head on the table,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.671#and even Jean's eyes were closing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.672#“Wait a bit!” resumed Baudu, seized with a sudden fit of anger, “such
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.673#jokers always go to smash! Mouret is hard-pushed just now; I know that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.674#for a fact. He's been forced to spend all his savings on his mania for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.675#extensions and advertisements. Moreover, in order to raise money, he has
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.676#induced most of his shop-people to invest all they possess with him. So
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.677#that he hasn't a sou to help himself with now; and, unless a miracle be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.678#worked, and he treble his sales, as he hopes to do, you'll see what a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.679#crash there'll be! Ah! I'm not ill-natured, but that day I'll illuminate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.680#my shop-front, on my word of honour!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.681#And he went on in a revengeful voice; one would have thought that the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.682#fall of The Ladies' Paradise was to restore the dignity and prestige
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.683#of compromised business. Had any one ever seen such a thing? A draper's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.684#shop selling everything! Why not call it a bazaar at once? And the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.685#employees! a nice set they were too--a lot of puppies, who did their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.686#work like porters at a railway station, treating goods and customers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.687#like so many parcels; leaving the shop or getting the sack at a moment's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.688#notice. No affection, no manners, no taste! And all at once he quoted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.689#Colomban as an example of a good tradesman, brought up in the old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.690#school, knowing how long it took to learn all the cunning and tricks of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.691#the trade. The art was not to sell a large quantity, but to sell dear.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.692#Colomban could say how he had been treated, carefully looked after, his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.693#washing and mending done, nursed in illness, considered as one of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.694#family--loved, in fact!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.695#“Of course,” repeated Colomban, after every statement the governor made.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.696#“Ah, you're the last of the old stock,” Baudu ended by declaring. “After
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.697#you're gone there'll be none left. You are my sole consolation, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.698#if they call all this sort of thing business I give up, I would rather
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.699#clear out.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.700#Geneviève, her head on one side, as if her thick hair were too heavy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.701#for her pale forehead, was watching the smiling shopman; and in her look
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.702#there was a suspicion, a wish to see whether Colomban, stricken with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.703#remorse, would not blush at all this praise. But, like a fellow up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.704#to every trick of the old trade, he preserved his quiet manner, his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.705#good-natured and cunning look. However, Baudu still went on, louder than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.706#ever, condemning the people opposite, calling them a pack of savages,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.707#murdering each other in their struggle for existence, destroying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.708#all family ties. And he mentioned some country neighbours, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.709#Lhommes--mother, father, and son--all employed in the infernal shop,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.710#people without any home life, always out, leading a comfortless, savage
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.711#existence, never dining at home except on Sunday, feeding all the week
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.712#at restaurants, hotels, anywhere. Certainly his dining-room wasn't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.713#too large nor too well-lighted; but it was part of their home, and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.714#family had grown up affectionately about the domestic hearth. Whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.715#speaking his eyes wandered about the room; and he shuddered at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.716#unavowed idea that the savages might one day, if they, succeeded
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.717#in ruining his trade, turn him out of this house where he was so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.718#comfortable with his wife and child. Notwithstanding the assurance
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.719#with which he predicted the utter downfall of his rivals, he was really
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.720#terrified, feeling that the neighbourhood was being gradually invaded
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.721#and devoured.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.722#“I don't want to disgust you,” resumed he, trying to calm himself; “if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.723#you think it to your interest to go there, I shall be the first to say,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.724#'go.'”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.725#“I am sure of that, uncle,” murmured Denise, bewildered, all this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.726#excitement rendering her more and more desirous of entering The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.727#Paradise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.728#He had put his elbows on the table, and was staring at her so hard
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.729#that she felt uneasy. “But look here,” resumed he; “you who know the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.730#business, do you think it right that a simple draper's shop should sell
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.731#everything? Formerly, when trade was trade, drapers sold nothing but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.732#drapery. Now they are doing their best to snap up every branch and ruin
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.733#their neighbours. The whole neighbourhood complains of it, for every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.734#small tradesman is beginning to suffer terribly. This Mouret is ruining
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.735#them. Bédoré and his sister, who keep the hosiery shop in the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.736#Gaillon, have already lost half their customers; Mademoiselle Tatin, at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.737#the under-linen warehouse in the Passage Choiseul, has been obliged to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.738#lower her prices, to be able to sell at all. And the effects of this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.739#scourge, this pest, are felt as far as the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.740#where I hear that Vanpouille Brothers, the furriers, cannot hold
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.741#out much longer. Drapers selling fur goods--what a farce! another of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.742#Mouret's ideas!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.743#“And gloves,” added Madame Baudu; “isn't it monstrous? He has even
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.744#dared to add a glove department! Yesterday, as I was going along the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.745#Neuve-Saint-Augustin, I saw Quinette, the glover, at his door, looking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.746#so downcast that I hadn't the heart to ask him how business was going.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.747#“And umbrellas,” resumed Baudu; “that's the climax! Bourras feels sure
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.748#that Mouret simply wants to ruin him; for, in short, where's the rhyme
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.749#between umbrellas and drapery? But Bourras is firm on his legs, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.750#won't allow himself to be beggared. We shall see some fun one of these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.751#days.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.752#He spoke of other tradesmen, passing the whole neigbour-hood in review.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.753#Now and again he let slip a confession. If Vinçard wanted to sell it was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.754#time for the rest to pack up, for Vinçard was like the rats who leave
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.755#a house when it threatens to fall in. Then, immediately after, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.756#contradicted himself, alluded to an alliance, an understanding between
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.757#the small tradesmen in order to fight the colossus. He hesitated an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.758#instant before speaking of himself, his hands shaking, and his mouth
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.759#twitching in a nervous manner. At last he made up his mind.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.760#“As for myself, I can't complain as yet. Of course he has done me harm,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.761#the scoundrel! But up to the present he only keeps ladies' cloths, light
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.762#stuffs for dresses and heavier goods for mantles. People still come to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.763#me for men's goods, velvets for shooting suits, cloths for liveries,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.764#without speaking of flannels and serges, of which I defy him to show
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.765#as good an assortment. But he thinks to annoy me by planting his cloth
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.766#department right in front of my door. You've seen his display, haven't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.767#you? He always places his finest made-up goods there, surrounded by a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.768#framework of various cloths--a cheap-jack parade to tempt the women.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.769#Upon my word, I should be ashamed to use such means! The Old Elbeuf has
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.770#been known for nearly a hundred years, and has no need for such at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.771#its door. As long as I live, it shall remain as I took it, with a few
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.772#samples on each side, and nothing more!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.773#The whole family was affected. Geneviève ventured to make a remark after
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.774#a silence:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.775#“You know, papa, our customers know and like us. We mustn't lose
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.776#heart Madame Desforges and Madame de Boves have been to-day, and I am
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.777#expecting Madame Marty for some flannel.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.778#“I,” declared Colomban, “I took an order from Madame Bourdelais
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.779#yesterday. 'Tis true she spoke of an English cheviot marked up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.780#opposite ten sous cheaper than ours, and the same stuff, it appears.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.781#“Fancy,” murmured Madame Baudu in her weak voice, “we knew that house
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.782#when it was scarcely larger than a handkerchief! Yes, my dear Denise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.783#when the Deleuzes started it, it had only one window in the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.784#Neuve-Saint-Augustin; and such a tiny one, in which there was barely
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.785#room for a couple of pieces of print and two or three pieces of calico.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.786#There was no room to turn round in the shop, it was so small. At that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.787#time The Old Elbeuf, after sixty years' trading, was as you see it now.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.788#Ah! all that has greatly changed!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.789#She shook her head; the drama of her whole life was expressed in these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.790#few words. Born in the old house, she loved every part of it, living
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.791#only for it and by it; and, formerly proud of this house, the finest,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.792#the best patronised in the neighbourhood, she had had the daily grief of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.793#seeing the rival establishment gradually growing in importance, at first
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.794#disdained, then equal to theirs, and finally towering above it, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.795#threatening all the rest. This was for her a continual, open sore; she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.796#was slowly dying from sheer grief at seeing The Old Elbeuf humiliated,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.797#though still living, as if by the force of impulse, like a machine wound
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.798#up. But she felt that the death of the shop would be hers as well, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.799#that she would never survive the closing of it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.800#There was a painful silence. Baudu was softly beating a tattoo with his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.801#fingers on the American cloth on the table. He experienced a sort of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.802#lassitude, almost a regret at having relieved his feelings once more in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.803#this way. In fact, the whole family felt the effects of his despondency,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.804#and could not help ruminating on the bitter story. They never had had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.805#any luck. The children had been educated and started in the world,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.806#fortune was beginning to smile on them, when suddenly this competition
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.807#sprang up and ruined their hopes. There was, also, the house at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.808#Rambouillet, that country house to which he had been dreaming of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.809#retiring for the last ten years--a bargain, he thought; but it had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.810#turned out to be an old building always wanting repairs, and which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.811#he had let to people who never paid any rent. His last profits were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.812#swallowed up by the place--the only folly he had committed in his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.813#honest, upright career as a tradesman, obstinately attached to the old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.814#ways.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.815#“Come, come!” said he, suddenly, “we must make room for the others.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.816#Enough of this useless talk!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.817#It was like an awakening. The gas hissed, in the dead and stifling air
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.818#of the small room. They all jumped up, breaking the melancholy silence.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.819#However, Pépé was sleeping so soundly that they laid him on some bales
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.820#of cloth. Jean had already returned to the street door yawning.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.821#“In short,” repeated Baudu to his niece, “you can do as you like. We
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.822#have explained the matter to you, that's all. You know your own business
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.823#best.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.824#He looked at her sharply, waiting for a decisive answer. Denise, whom
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.825#these stories had inspired with a still greater longing to enter The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.826#Ladies' Paradise, instead of turning her from it, preserved her quiet
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.827#gentle demeanour with a Norman obstinacy. She simply replied: “We shall
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.828#see, uncle.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.829#And she spoke of going to bed early with the children, for they were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.830#all three very tired. But it had only just struck six, so she decided to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.831#stay in the shop a little longer. Night had come on, and she found
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.832#the street quite dark, enveloped in a fine close rain, which had been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.833#falling since sunset. She was surprised. A few minutes had sufficed to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.834#fill the street with small pools, a stream of dirty water was running
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.835#along the gutters, the pavement was thick with a sticky black mud;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.836#and through the beating rain she saw nothing but a confused stream of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.837#umbrellas, pushing, swinging along in the gloom like great black wings.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.838#She started back at first, feeling very cold, oppressed at heart by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.839#badly-lighted shop, very dismal at this hour of the day. A damp breeze,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.840#the breath of the old quarter, came in from the street; it seemed that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.841#the rain, streaming from the umbrellas, was running right into the shop,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.842#that the pavement with its mud and its puddles extended all over the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.843#place, putting the finishing touches to the mouldiness of the old shop
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.844#front, white with saltpetre. It was quite a vision of old Paris, damp
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.845#and uncomfortable, which made her shiver, astonished and heart-broken to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.846#find the great city so cold and so ugly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.847#But opposite, the gas-lamps were being lighted all along the frontage of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.848#The Ladies' Paradise. She moved nearer, again attracted and, as it were,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.849#warmed by this wealth of illumination. The machine was still roaring,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.850#active as ever, hissing forth its last clouds of steam; whilst the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.851#salesmen were folding up the stuffs, and the cashiers counting up the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.852#receipts. It was, as seen through the hazy windows, a vague swarming of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.853#lights, a confused factory-like interior. Behind the curtain of falling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.854#rain, this apparition, distant and confused, assumed the appearance of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.855#a giant furnace-house, where the black shadows of the firemen could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.856#be seen passing by the red glare of the furnaces. The displays in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.857#windows became indistinct also; one could only distinguish the snowy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.858#lace, heightened in its whiteness by the ground glass globes of a row of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.859#gas jets, and against this chapel-like background the ready-made goods
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.860#stood out vigorously, the velvet mantle trimmed with silver fox threw
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.861#into relief the curved profile of a headless woman running through the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.862#rain to some entertainment in the unknown of the shades of the Paris
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.863#night.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.864#Denise, yielding to the seduction, had gone to the door, heedless of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.865#raindrops falling on her. At this hour, The Ladies' Paradise, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.866#its furnace-like brilliancy, entirely conquered her. In the great
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.867#metropolis, black and silent, beneath the rain--in this Paris, to which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.868#she was a stranger, it shone out like a lighthouse, and seemed to be of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.869#itself the life and light of the city. She dreamed of her future there,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.870#working hard to bring up the children, and of other things besides--she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.871#hardly knew what--far-off things, the desire and the fear of which made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.872#her tremble. The idea of this woman who had met her death amidst the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.873#foundations came back to her; she felt afraid, she thought she saw the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.874#lights bleeding; then, the whiteness of the lace quieting her, a vague
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.875#hope sprang up in her heart, quite a certainty of happiness; whilst the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.876#fine rain, blowing on her, cooled her hands, and calmed her after the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.877#excitement of her journey.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.878#“It's Bourras,” said a voice behind her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.879#She leant forward, and perceived the umbrella-maker, motionless
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.880#before the window containing the ingenious display of umbrellas and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.881#walking-sticks. The old man had slipped up there in the dark, to feast
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.882#his eyes on the triumphant show; and so great was his grief that he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.883#was unconscious of the rain which was beating on his bare head, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.884#trickling off his white hair.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.885#“How stupid he is, he'll make himself ill,” resumed the voice.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.886#Turning round, Denise found the Baudus behind her again. Though they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.887#thought Bourras so stupid, they were obliged, against their will, to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.888#return to this spectacle which was breaking their hearts. Genevieve,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.889#very pale, had noticed that Colomban was watching the shadows of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.890#saleswomen pass to and fro on the first floor opposite; and, whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.891#Baudu was choking with suppressed rancour, Madame Baudu was silently
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.892#weeping.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.893#“You'll go and see to-morrow, won't you, Denise?” asked the draper,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.894#tormented with uncertainty, but feeling that his niece was conquered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.895#like the rest.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.896#She hesitated, then gently replied: “Yes, uncle, unless it pains you too
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:i.897#much.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.1#CHAPTER II.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.2#The next morning, at half-past seven, Denise was outside The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.3#Paradise, wishing to call there before taking Jean to his new place,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.4#which was a long way off, at the top of the Faubourg du Temple. But,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.5#accustomed to early hours, she had arrived too soon; the shop was hardly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.6#opened, and, afraid of looking ridiculous, full of timidity, she walked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.7#up and down the Place Gaillon for a moment.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.8#The cold wind that blew had already dried the pavement. Shopmen were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.9#hurriedly turning out of every street in the neighbourhood, their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.10#coat-collars turned up, and their hands in their pockets, taken unawares
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.11#by this first chill of winter. Most of them hurried along alone, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.12#disappeared in the depths of the warehouse, without addressing a word
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.13#or look to their colleagues marching along by their side. Others were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.14#walking in twos and threes, talking fast, and taking up the whole of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.15#the pavement; while they all threw away with a similar gesture, their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.16#cigarette or cigar before crossing the threshold.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.17#Denise noticed that several of these gentlemen took stock of her in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.18#passing. This increased her timidity; she felt quite unable to follow
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.19#them, and resolved to wait till they had all entered before going in,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.20#blushing at the idea of being elbowed at the door by all these men. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.21#the stream continued, so to escape their looks, she took a walk round.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.22#When she returned to the principal entrance, she found a tall young man,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.23#pale and awkward, who appeared to be waiting as she was.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.24#“I beg your pardon, mademoiselle,” he finished by stammering out, “but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.25#perhaps you belong to the establishment?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.26#She was so troubled at hearing a stranger address her in this way that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.27#she did not reply at first.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.28#“The fact is,” he continued, getting more confused than ever, “I thought
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.29#of asking them to engage me, and you might have given me a little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.30#information.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.31#He was as timid as she was, and had probably risked speaking to her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.32#because he felt she was trembling like himself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.33#“I would with pleasure, sir,” replied she at last “But I'm no better off
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.34#than you are; I'm just going to apply myself.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.35#“Ah, very good,” said he, quite out of countenance.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.36#And they blushed violently, their two timidities remaining face to face
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.37#for a moment, affected by the similarity of their positions, not daring,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.38#however, to wish each other success openly. Then, as they said nothing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.39#further, and became more and more uncomfortable, they separated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.40#awkwardly, and recommenced their waiting, one on either side, a few
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.41#steps apart.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.42#The shopmen continued to arrive, and Denise could now hear them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.43#joking as they passed, casting side glances towards her. Her confusion
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.44#increased at finding herself exposed to this unpleasant ordeal, and she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.45#had decided to take half an hour's walk in the neighbourhood, when the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.46#sight of a young man coming rapidly through the Rue Port-Mahon, detained
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.47#her for a moment. He was evidently the manager of a department, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.48#thought, for the others raised their hats to him. He was tall, with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.49#clear skin and carefully trimmed beard; and he had eyes the colour of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.50#old gold, of a velvety softness, which he fixed on her for a moment as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.51#he crossed the street. He already entered the shop, indifferent that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.52#she remained motionless, quite upset by his look, filled with a singular
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.53#emotion, in which there was more uneasiness than pleasure. She began
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.54#to feel really afraid, and, to give herself time to collect her courage
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.55#somewhat, she walked slowly down the Rue Gaillon, and then along the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.56#Saint-Roch.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.57#It was better than a manager of a department, it was Octave Mouret in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.58#person. He had not been to bed, for after having spent the evening at a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.59#stockbroker's, he had gone to supper with a friend and two women, picked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.60#up behind the scenes of a small theatre. His tightly buttoned overcoat
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.61#concealed a dress suit and white tie. He quickly ran upstairs, performed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.62#his toilet, changed, and entered his office, quite ready for work, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.63#beaming eyes, and complexion as fresh as if he had had ten hours' sleep.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.64#The spacious office, furnished in old oak and hung with green rep, had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.65#for sole ornament the portrait of that Madame Hédouin, who was still the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.66#talk of the neighbourhood. Since her death Octave thought of her with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.67#a tender regret, showing himself grateful to the memory of her, who, by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.68#marrying him, had made his fortune. And before commencing to sign the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.69#drafts laid on his desk, he bestowed the contented smile of a happy man
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.70#on the portrait Was it not always before her that he returned to work,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.71#after his young widower's escapades, every time he issued from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.72#alcoves where his craving for amusement attracted him?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.73#There was a knock, and without waiting, a young man entered, a tall,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.74#thin fellow, with thin lips and a sharp nose, very gentlemanly and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.75#correct in his appearance, with his smooth hair already showing signs of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.76#turning grey. Mouret raised his eyes, then continuing to sign, said:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.77#“I hope you slept well, Bourdoncle?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.78#“Very well, thanks,” replied the young man, walking about as if quite at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.79#home.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.80#Bourdoncle, the son of a poor farmer near Limoges, had started at The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.81#Ladies' Paradise at the same time as Mouret, when it only occupied the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.82#corner of the Place Gaillon. Very intelligent, very active, it seemed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.83#as if he ought to have easily supplanted his comrade, who was not so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.84#steady, and who had, besides various other faults, a careless manner
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.85#and too many intrigues with women; but he lacked that touch of genius
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.86#possessed by the impassioned Southerner, and had not his audacity, his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.87#winning grace. Besides, by a wise instinct, he had always, from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.88#first, bowed before him, obedient and without a struggle; and when
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.89#Mouret advised his people to put all their money into the business,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.90#Bourdoncle was one of the first to respond, even investing the proceeds
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.91#of an unexpected legacy left him by an aunt; and little by little,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.92#after passing through the various grades, salesman, second, and then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.93#first-hand in the silk department, he had become one of the governor's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.94#most cherished and influential lieutenants, one of the six persons who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.95#assisted Mouret to govern The Ladies' Paradise--something like a privy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.96#council under an absolute king. Each one watched over a department.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.97#Bourdoncle exercised a general control.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.98#“And you,” resumed he, familiarly, “have you slept well?” When Mouret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.99#replied that he had not been to bed, he shook his head, murmuring: “Bad
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.100#habits.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.101#“Why?” replied the other, gaily. “I'm not so tired as you are, my dear
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.102#fellow. You are half asleep now, you lead too quiet a life. Take a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.103#little amusement, that'll wake you up a bit.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.104#This was their constant friendly dispute. Bourdoncle had, at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.105#commencement, beaten his mistresses, because, said he, they prevented
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.106#him sleeping. Now he professed to hate women, having, no doubt, chance
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.107#love affairs of which he said nothing, so small was the place they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.108#occupied in his life; he contented himself with encouraging the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.109#extravagance of his lady customers, feeling the greatest disdain for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.110#their frivolity, which led them to ruin themselves in stupid gewgaws.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.111#Mouret, on the contrary, affected to worship them, remained before them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.112#delighted and cajoling, continually carried away by fresh love-affairs;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.113#and this served as an advertisement for his business. One would have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.114#said that he enveloped all the women in the same caress, the better to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.115#bewilder them and keep them at his mercy.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.116#“I saw Madame Desforges last night,” said he; “she was looking delicious
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.117#at the ball.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.118#“But it wasn't with her that you went to supper, was it?” asked the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.119#other.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.120#Mouret protested. “Oh! no, she's very virtuous, my dear fellow. I went
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.121#to supper with little Héloïse, of the Folly. Stupid as a donkey, but so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.122#comical!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.123#He took another bundle of drafts and went on signing. Bourdoncle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.124#continued to walk about. He went and took a look through the lofty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.125#plate-glass windows, into the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin, then returned,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.126#saying: “You know they'll have their revenge.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.127#“Who?” asked Mouret, who had lost the thread of the conversation.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.128#“Why, the women.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.129#At this, Mouret became merrier still, displaying, beneath his sensual,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.130#adorative manner, his really brutal character. With a shrug of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.131#shoulders he seemed to declare he would throw them all over, like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.132#so many empty sacks, when they had finished helping him to make his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.133#fortune. Bourdoncle obstinately repeated, in his cold way: “They will
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.134#have their revenge; there will be one who will avenge all the others.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.135#It's bound to be.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.136#“No fear,” cried Mouret, exaggerating his Southern accent. “That one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.137#isn't born yet, my boy. And if she comes, you know----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.138#He had raised his penholder, brandishing it and pointing it in the air,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.139#as if he would have liked to stab some invisible heart with a knife.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.140#Bourdoncle resumed walking, bowing as usual before the superiority of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.141#the governor, whose genius, though faulty, had always got the better of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.142#him. He, so clear-headed, logical and passionless, incapable of falling,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.143#had yet to learn the feminine character of success, Paris yielding
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.144#herself with a kiss to the boldest.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.145#A silence reigned, broken only by Mouret's pen. Then, in reply to his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.146#brief questions, Bourdoncle gave him the particulars of the great sale
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.147#of winter novelties, which was to commence the following Monday. This
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.148#was an important affair, and the house was risking its fortune in it;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.149#for the rumour had some foundation, Mouret was throwing himself into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.150#speculation like a poet, with such ostentation, such a determination to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.151#attain the colossal, that everything seemed bound to give way under
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.152#him. It was quite a new style of doing business, an apparent commercial
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.153#recklessness which had formerly made Madame Hédouin anxious, and which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.154#even now, notwithstanding the first successes, quite dismayed those
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.155#who had capital in the business. They blamed the governor in secret for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.156#going too quick; accused him of having enlarged the establishment to a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.157#dangerous extent, before making sure of a sufficient increase of custom;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.158#above all, they trembled on seeing him put all the capital into one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.159#venture, filling the place with a pile of goods without leaving a sou in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.160#the reserve fund. Thus, for this sale, after the heavy sums paid to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.161#builders, the whole capital was out, and it was once more a question of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.162#victory or death. And he, in the midst of all this excitement, preserved
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.163#a triumphant gaiety, a certainty of gaining millions, like a man
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.164#worshipped by the women, and who cannot be betrayed. When Bourdoncle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.165#ventured to express certain fears with reference to the too great
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.166#development given to several not very productive departments, he broke
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.167#out into a laugh full of confidence, and exclaimed:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.168#“No fear! my dear fellow, the place is too small!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.169#The other appeared dumbfounded, seized with a fear he no longer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.170#attempted to conceal. The house too small! a draper's shop having
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.171#nineteen departments, and four hundred and three employees!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.172#“Of course,” resumed Mouret, “we shall be obliged to enlarge our
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.173#premises before another eighteen months. I'm seriously thinking about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.174#the matter. Last night Madame Desforges promised to introduce me to some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.175#one. In short, we'll talk it over when the idea is ripe.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.176#And having finished signing his drafts, he got up, and tapped his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.177#lieutenant on the shoulder in a friendly manner, but the latter could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.178#not get over his astonishment. The fright felt by the prudent people
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.179#around him amused Mouret. In one of his fits of brusque frankness with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.180#which he sometimes overwhelmed his familiars, he declared he was at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.181#heart a bigger Jew than all the Jews in the world; he took after his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.182#father, whom he resembled physically and morally, a fellow who knew
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.183#the value of money; and, if his mother had given him that particle of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.184#nervous fantasy, why it was, perhaps, the principal element of his luck,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.185#for he felt the invincible force of his daring reckless grace.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.186#“You know very well that we'll stand by you to the last,” Bourdoncle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.187#finished by saying.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.188#Before going down into the various departments to give their usual look
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.189#round, they settled certain other details. They examined the specimen of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.190#a little book of account forms, which Mouret had just invented for use
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.191#at the counters. Having remarked that the old-fashioned goods, the dead
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.192#stock, went off all the more rapidly when the commission given to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.193#employees was high, he had based on this observation a new system. In
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.194#future he intended to interest his people in the sale of all goods,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.195#giving them a commission on the smallest piece of stuff, the slightest
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.196#article sold: a system which had caused a revolution in the drapery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.197#trade, creating between the salespeople a struggle for existence of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.198#which the proprietor reaped the benefit. This struggle formed his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.199#favourite method, the principle of organisation he constantly applied.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.200#He excited his employees' passions, pitted one against the other,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.201#allowed the strongest to swallow up the weakest, fattening on this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.202#interested struggle. The specimen book was approved of; at the top
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.203#of the two forms--the one retained, and the one torn off--were the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.204#particulars of the department and the salesman's number; then there were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.205#columns on both for the measurement, description of the articles sold,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.206#and the price; the salesman simply signed the bill before handing it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.207#to the cashier. In this way an easy account was kept, it sufficed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.208#to compare the bills delivered by the cashier's department to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.209#clearing-house with the salesmen's counterfoils. Every week the latter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.210#would receive their commission, and that without the least possibility
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.211#of any error.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.212#“We sha'n't be robbed so much,” remarked Bourdoncle, with satisfaction.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.213#“A very good idea of yours.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.214#“And I thought of something else last night,” explained Mouret. “Yes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.215#my dear fellow, at the supper. I should like to give the clearing-house
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.216#clerks a trifle for every error found in checking. You can understand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.217#that we shall then be certain they won't pass any, for they would rather
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.218#invent some.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.219#He began to laugh, whilst the other looked at him in admiration. This
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.220#new application of the struggle for existence delighted Mouret; he had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.221#a real genius for administrative business, and dreamed of organising the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.222#house, so as to play upon the selfish instincts of his employees, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.223#the complete and quiet satisfaction of his own appetites. He often said
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.224#that to make people do their best, and even to keep them fairly honest,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.225#it was necessary to excite their selfish desires first.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.226#“Well, let's go downstairs,” resumed Mouret. “We must look after this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.227#sale. The silk arrived yesterday, I believe, and Bouthemont must be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.228#getting it in now.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.229#Bourdoncle followed him. The receiving office was on the basement floor,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.230#in the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin. There, on a level with the pavement,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.231#was a kind of glazed cage, where the vans discharged the goods. They
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.232#were weighed, and then slipped down a rapid slide, its oak and iron
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.233#work shining, brightened by the chafing of goods and cases. Everything
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.234#entered by this yawning trap; it was a continual swallowing up, a fall
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.235#of goods, causing a roaring like that of a cataract. At the approach of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.236#big sale times especially, the slide carried down a perpetual stream of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.237#Lyons silks, English woollens, Flemish linens, Alsatian calicoes, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.238#Rouen printed goods; and the vans were sometimes obliged to wait their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.239#turn along the street; the bales running down produced the peculiar
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.240#noise made by a stone thrown into deep water.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.241#Mouret stopped a moment before the slide, which was in full activity.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.242#Rows of cases were going down of themselves, falling like rain from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.243#some upper stream. Then some huge bales appeared, toppling over in their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.244#descent like so many pebbles. Mouret looked on, without saying a word.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.245#But this wealth of goods rushing in at the rate of thousands of francs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.246#a minute, made his eyes glisten. He had never before had such a clear,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.247#definite idea of the struggle he was engaged in. Here was this mountain
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.248#of goods that he had to launch to the four corners of Paris. He did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.249#open his mouth, continuing his inspection.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.250#By the grey light penetrating the air-holes, a squad of men were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.251#receiving the goods, whilst others were undoing and opening the cases
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.252#and bales in presence of the managers of different departments. A
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.253#dockyard agitation filled this cellar, this basement, where wrought-iron
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.254#pillars supported the arches, and the bare walls of which were cemented.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.255#“Have you got all there, Bouthemont?” asked Mouret, going up to a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.256#broad-shouldered young fellow who was check» ing the contents of a case.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.257#“Yes, everything seems all right,” replied he; “but the counting will
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.258#take me all the morning.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.259#The manager was glancing at the invoice every now and then, standing up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.260#before a large counter on which one of his salesmen was laying, one by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.261#one, the pieces of silk he was taking from the case. Behind them ran
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.262#other counters, also encumbered with goods that a small army of shopmen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.263#were examining. It was a general unpacking, an apparent confusion of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.264#stuffs, examined, turned over, and marked, amidst a buzz of voices.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.265#Bouthemont, a celebrity in the trade, had a round, jolly face, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.266#coal-black beard, and fine hazel eyes. Born at Montpellier, noisy, too
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.267#fond of company, he was not much good for the sales, but for buying he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.268#had not his equal. Sent to Paris by his father, who kept a draper's shop
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.269#in his native town, he had absolutely refused to return when the old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.270#fellow thought he ought to know enough to succeed him in his business;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.271#and from that moment a rivalry sprung up between father and son, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.272#former, all for his little country business, shocked to see a simple
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.273#shopman earning three times as much as he did himself, the latter joking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.274#at the old man's routine, chinking his money, and throwing the whole
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.275#house into confusion at every flying visit he paid. Like the other
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.276#managers, Bouthemont drew, besides his three thousand francs regular
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.277#pay, a commission on the sales. Montpèllier, surprised and respectful,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.278#whispered that young Bouthemont had made fifteen thousand francs the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.279#year before, and that that was only a beginning--people prophesied to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.280#the exasperated father that this figure would certainly increase.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.281#Bourdoncle had taken up one of the pieces of silk, and was examining
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.282#the grain with the eye of a connoisseur. It was a faille with a blue and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.283#silver selvage, the famous Paris Paradise, with which Mouret hoped to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.284#strike a decisive blow.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.285#“It is really very good,” observed Bourdoncle.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.286#“And the effect it produces is better than its real quality,” said
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.287#Bouthemont. “Dumonteil is the only one capable of manufacturing such
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.288#stuff. Last journey when I fell out with Gaujean, the latter was willing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.289#to set a hundred looms to work on this pattern, but he asked five sous a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.290#yard more.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.291#Nearly every month Bouthemont went to Lyons, staying there days
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.292#together, living at the best hotels, with orders to treat the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.293#manufacturers with open purse. He enjoyed, moreover, a perfect liberty,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.294#and bought what he liked, provided that he increased the yearly business
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.295#of his department in a certain proportion, settled beforehand; and it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.296#was on this proportion that his commission was based. In short, his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.297#position at The Ladies' Paradise, like that of all the managers, was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.298#that of a special tradesman, in a grouping of various businesses, a sort
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.299#of vast trading city.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.300#“So,” resumed he, “it's decided we mark it five francs twelve sous? It's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.301#barely the cost price, you know.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.302#“Yes, yes, five francs twelve sous,” said Mouret, quickly; “and if I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.303#were alone, I'd sell it at a loss.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.304#The manager laughed heartily. “Oh! I don't mind, that will just suit
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.305#me; it will treble the sale, and as my only interest is to attain heavy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.306#receipts----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.307#But Bourdoncle remained very grave, biting his lips. He drew his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.308#commission on the total profits, and it did not suit him to lower the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.309#prices. Part of his business was to exercise a control over the prices
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.310#fixed upon, to prevent Bouthemont selling at too small a profit in order
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.311#to increase the sales. Moreover, his former anxiety reappeared in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.312#presence of these advertising combinations which he did not understand.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.313#He ventured to show his repugnance by saying:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.314#“If we sell it at five francs twelve sous, it will be like selling it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.315#at a loss, as we must allow for our expenses, which are considerable. It
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.316#would fetch seven francs anywhere.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.317#At this Mouret got angry. He struck the silk with his open hand,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.318#crying out excitedly: “I know that, that's why I want to give it to our
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.319#customers. Really, my dear fellow, you'll never understand women's ways.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.320#Don't you see they'll be crazy after this silk?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.321#“No doubt,” interrupted the other, obstinately, “and the more they buy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.322#the more we shall lose.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.323#“We shall lose a few sous on the stuff, very likely. What matters, if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.324#in return we attract all the women here, and keep them at our mercy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.325#excited by the sight of our goods, emptying their purses without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.326#thinking? The principal thing, my dear fellow, is to inflame them, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.327#for that you must have one article which flatters them--which causes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.328#a sensation. Afterwards, you can sell the other articles as dear as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.329#anywhere else, they'll still think yours the cheapest. For instance, our
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.330#Golden Grain, that taffeta at seven francs and a half, sold everywhere
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.331#at that price, will go down as an extraordinary bargain, and suffice to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.332#make up for the loss on the Paris Paradise. You'll see, you'll see!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.333#He became quite eloquent.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.334#“Don't you understand? In a week's time from to-day I want the Paris
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.335#Paradise to make a revolution in the market. It's our master-stroke,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.336#which will save us, and get our name up. Nothing else will be talked of;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.337#the blue and silver selvage will be known from one end of France to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.338#other. And you'll hear the furious complaints of our competitors. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.339#small traders will lose another wing by it; they'll be done for, all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.340#those rheumatic old brokers shivering in their cellars!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.341#The shopmen checking the goods round about were listening and smiling.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.342#He liked to talk in this way without contradiction. Bourdoncle yielded
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.343#once more. However, the case was empty, two men were opening another.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.344#“It's the manufacturers who are not exactly pleased,” said Bouthemont.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.345#“At Lyons they are all furious with you, they pretend that your cheap
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.346#trading is ruining them. You are aware that Gaujean has positively
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.347#declared war against me. Yes, he has sworn to give the little houses
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.348#longer credit, rather than accept my prices.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.349#Mouret shrugged his shoulders. “If Gaujean doesn't look sharp,” replied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.350#he, “Gaujean will be floored. What do they complain of? We pay ready
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.351#money and we take all they can make; it's strange if they can't work
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.352#cheaper at that rate. Besides, the public gets the benefit, and that's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.353#everything.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.354#The shopman was emptying the second case, whilst Bouthemont was checking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.355#the pieces by the invoice. Another shopman, at the end of the counter,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.356#was marking them in plain figures, and the checking finished, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.357#invoice, signed by the manager, had to be sent to the chief cashier's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.358#office. Mouret continued looking at this work for a moment, at all this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.359#activity round this unpacking of goods which threatened to drown
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.360#the basement; then, without adding a word, with the air of a captain
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.361#satisfied with his troops, he went away, followed by Bourdoncle.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.362#They slowly crossed the basement floor. The air-holes placed at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.363#intervals admitted a pale light; while in the dark corners, and along
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.364#the narrow corridors, gas was constantly burning. In these corridors
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.365#were situated the reserves, large vaults closed with iron railings,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.366#containing the surplus goods of each department. Mouret glanced in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.367#passing at the heating apparatus, to be lighted on the Monday for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.368#the first time, and at the post of firemen guarding a giant gas-meter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.369#enclosed in an iron cage. The kitchen and dining-rooms, old cellars
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.370#turned into habitable apartments, were on the left at the corner of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.371#Place Gaillon. At last he arrived at the delivery department, right at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.372#the other end of the basement floor. The parcels not taken away by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.373#customers were sent down there, sorted on tables, placed in compartments
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.374#each representing a district of Paris; then sent up by a large staircase
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.375#opening just opposite The Old Elbeuf, to the vans standing alongside
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.376#the pavement. In the mechanical working of The Ladies' Paradise, this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.377#staircase in the Rue de la Michodière disgorged without ceasing the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.378#goods swallowed up by the slide in the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin, after
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.379#they had passed through the mechanism of the counters up above.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.380#“Campion,” said Mouret to the delivery manager, a retired sergeant
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.381#with a thin face, “why weren't six pairs of sheets, bought by a lady
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.382#yesterday about two o'clock, delivered in the evening?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.383#“Where does the lady live?” asked the employee..
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.384#“In the Rue de Rivoli, at the corner of the Rue d'Alger--Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.385#Desforges.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.386#At this early hour the sorting tables were bare, the compartment only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.387#contained a few parcels left over night Whilst Campion was searching
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.388#amongst these packets, after having consulted a list, Bourdoncle was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.389#looking at Mouret, thinking that this wonderful fellow knew everything,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.390#thought of everything, even when at the supper-tables of restaurants or
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.391#in the alcoves of his mistresses. At last Campion discovered the error;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.392#the cashier's department had given a wrong number, and the parcel had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.393#come back.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.394#“What is the number of the pay-desk that debited that?” asked Mouret:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.395#“No. 10, you say?” And turning towards his lieutenant, he added: “No.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.396#10; that's Albert, isn't it? We'll just say two words to him.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.397#But before starting on their tour round the shops, he wanted to go up to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.398#the postal order department, which occupied several rooms on the second
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.399#floor. It was there that all the provincial and foreign orders arrived;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.400#and he went up every morning to see the correspondence. For two years
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.401#this correspondence had been increasing daily. At first occupying only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.402#about ten clerks, it now required more than thirty. Some opened the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.403#letters, others read them, seated at both sides of the same table;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.404#others again classed them, giving each one a running number, which was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.405#repeated on a pigeon-hole. Then when the letters had been distributed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.406#to the different departments and the latter had delivered the articles,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.407#these articles were put in the pigeon-holes as they arrived, according
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.408#to the running numbers. There was then nothing to do but to check and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.409#tie them up, which was done in a neighbouring room by a squad of workmen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.410#who were nailing and tying up from morning to night.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.411#Mouret put his usual question: “How many letters this morning,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.412#Levasseur?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.413#“Five hundred and thirty-four, sir,” replied the chief clerk. “After the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.414#commencement of Monday's sale, I'm afraid we sha'n't have enough hands.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.415#Yesterday we were driven very hard.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.416#Bourdoncle expressed his satisfaction by a nod of the head. He had not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.417#reckoned on five hundred and thirty-four letters on a Tuesday. Round
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.418#the table, the clerks continued opening and reading the letters amidst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.419#a noise of rustling paper, whilst the going and coming of the various
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.420#articles commenced before the pigeon-holes. It was one of the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.421#complicated and important departments of the establishment, one in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.422#which there was a continual rush, for, strictly speaking, all the orders
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.423#received in the morning ought to be sent off the same evening.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.424#“You shall have more hands if you want them,” replied Mouret, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.425#had seen at a glance that the work was well done. “You know that when
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.426#there's work to be done we never refuse the men.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.427#Up above, under the roof, were the small bedrooms for the saleswomen.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.428#But he went downstairs again and entered the chief cashier's office,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.429#which was near his own. It was a room with a glazed wicket, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.430#contained an enormous safe, fixed in the wall. Two cashiers there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.431#centralised the receipts which Lhomme, the chief cashier at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.432#counters, brought in every evening; they also settled the current
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.433#expenses, paid the manufacturers, the staff, all the crowd of people who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.434#lived by the house. The cashiers' office communicated with another, full
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.435#of green cardboard boxes, where ten clerks checked the invoices. Then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.436#came another office, the clearing-house: six young men bending over
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.437#black desks, having behind them quite a collection of registers, were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.438#getting up the discount accounts of the salesmen, by checking the debit
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.439#notes. This work, which was new to them, did not get on very well.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.440#Mouret and Bourdoncle had crossed the cashiers' office and the invoice
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.441#room. When they passed through the other office the young men, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.442#were laughing and joking, started up in surprise. Mouret, without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.443#reprimanding them, explained the system of the little bonus he thought
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.444#of giving them for each error discovered in the debit notes; and when he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.445#went out the clerks left off laughing, as if they had been whipped, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.446#commenced working in earnest, looking up the errors.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.447#On the ground-floor, occupied by the shops, Mouret went straight to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.448#pay-desk No. 10, where Albert Lhomme was cleaning his nails, waiting for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.449#customers. People regularly spoke of “the Lhomme dynasty,” since Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.450#Aurélie, firsthand at the dress department, after having helped her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.451#husband on to the post of chief cashier, had managed to get a pay
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.452#desk for her son, a tall fellow, pale and vicious, who couldn't stop
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.453#anywhere, and who caused her an immense deal of anxiety. But on reaching
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.454#the young man, Mouret kept in the background, not wishing to render
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.455#himself unpopular by performing a policeman's duty, and retaining from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.456#policy and taste his part of amiable god. He nudged Bourdoncle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.457#gently with his elbow--Bourdoncle, the infallible man, that model of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.458#exactitude, whom he generally charged with the work of reprimanding.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.459#“Monsieur Albert,” said the latter, severely, “you have taken another
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.460#address wrong; the parcel has come back. It's unbearable!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.461#The cashier, thinking it his duty to defend himself, called as a witness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.462#the messenger who had tied up the packet. This messenger, named Joseph,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.463#also belonged to the Lhomme dynasty, for he was Albert's foster brother,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.464#and owed his place to Madame Aurelie's influence, As the young man
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.465#wanted to make him say it was the customer's mistake, Joseph stuttered,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.466#twisted the shaggy beard that ornamented his scarred face, struggling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.467#between his old soldier's conscience and gratitude towards his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.468#protectors.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.469#“Let Joseph alone,” Bourdoncle exclaimed at last, “and don't say
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.470#any more. Ah! it's a lucky thing for you that we are mindful of your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.471#mother's good services!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.472#But at this moment Lhomme came running up. From his office near the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.473#door he could see his son's pay-desk, which was in the glove department.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.474#Quite white-haired already, deadened by his sedentary life, he had a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.475#flabby, colourless face, as if worn out by the reflection of the money
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.476#he was continually handling. His amputated arm did not at all incommode
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.477#him in this work, and it was quite a curiosity to see him verify the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.478#receipts, so rapidly did the notes and coins slip through his left one,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.479#the only one he had. Son of a tax-collector at Chablis, he had come to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.480#Paris as a clerk in the office of a merchant of the Port-aux-Vins.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.481#Then, whilst lodging in the Rue Cuvier, he married the daughter of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.482#doorkeeper, a small tailor, an Alsatian; and from that day he had bowed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.483#submissively before his wife, whose commercial ability filled him with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.484#respect. She earned more than twelve thousand francs a year in the dress
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.485#department, whilst he only drew a fixed salary of five thousand francs.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.486#And the deference he felt for a woman bringing such sums into the home
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.487#was extended to the son, who also belonged to her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.488#“What's the matter?” murmured he; “is Albert in fault?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.489#Then, according to his custom, Mouret appeared on the scene, to play the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.490#part of good-natured prince. When Bour-doncle had made himself feared,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.491#he looked after his own popularity.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.492#“Nothing of consequence!” murmured he. “My dear Lhomme, your son Albert
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.493#is a careless fellow, who should take an example from you.” Then,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.494#changing the subject, showing himself more amiable than ever, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.495#continued; “And that concert the other day--did you get a good seat?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.496#A blush overspread the white cheeks of the old cashier. Music was his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.497#only vice, a vice which he indulged in solitarily, frequenting the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.498#theatres, the concerts, the rehearsals. Notwithstanding the loss of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.499#his arm, he played on the French horn, thanks to an ingenious system of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.500#keys; and as Madame Lhomme detested noise, he wrapped up his instrument
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.501#in cloth in the evening, delighted all the same, in the highest
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.502#degree, with the strangely dull sounds he drew from it. In the forced
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.503#irregularity of their domestic life he had made himself an oasis of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.504#this music--that and the cash-box, he knew of nothing else, beyond the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.505#admiration he felt for his wife.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.506#“A very good seat,” replied he, with sparkling eyes. “You are really too
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.507#kind, sir.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.508#Mouret, who enjoyed a personal pleasure in satisfying other people's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.509#passions, sometimes gave Lhomme the tickets forced on him by the lady
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.510#patronesses of such entertainments, and he completed the old man's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.511#delight by saying:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.512#“Ah, Beethoven! ah, Mozart! What music!” And without waiting for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.513#a reply, he went off, rejoining Bourdoncle, already on his tour of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.514#inspection through the departments.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.515#In the central hall, an inner courtyard with a glass roof formed the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.516#silk department. Both went along the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin, occupied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.517#by the linen department, from one end to the other. Nothing unusual
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.518#striking them, they passed on through the crowd of respectful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.519#assistants. They then turned into the cotton and hosiery departments,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.520#where the same order reigned. But in the department devoted to woollens,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.521#occupying the gallery which ran through to the Rue de la Michodière,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.522#Bourdoncle resumed the character of executioner, on observing a young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.523#man, seated on the counter, looking knocked up after a night passed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.524#without sleep. And this young man, named Liénard, son of a rich Angers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.525#draper, bowed his head beneath the reprimand, fearing nothing in his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.526#idle, careless life of pleasure except to be recalled by his father. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.527#reprimands now began to shower down, and the gallery of the Rue de
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.528#la Michodière received the full force of the storm. In the drapery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.529#department a salesman, a fresh hand, who slept in the house, had come
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.530#in after eleven o'clock; in the haberdashery department, the second
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.531#counterman had just allowed himself to be caught downstairs smoking a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.532#cigarette. But the tempest burst with especial violence in the glove
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.533#department, on the head of one of the rare Parisians in the house,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.534#handsome Mignot, as they called him, the illegitimate son of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.535#music-mistress: his crime was having caused a scandal in the dining-room
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.536#by complaining of the food. As there were three tables, one at half-past
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.537#nine, one at half-past ten, and another at half-past eleven, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.538#wished to explain that belonging to the third table, he always had the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.539#leavings, the worst of everything.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.540#“What! the food not good?” asked Mouret, naïvely, opening his mouth at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.541#last.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.542#He only gave the head cook, a terrible Auvergnat, a franc and a half a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.543#head per day, out of which this man still managed to make a good
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.544#profit; and the food was really execrable. But Bourdoncle shrugged
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.545#his shoulders: a cook who had four hundred luncheons and four hundred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.546#dinners to serve, even in three series, had no time to waste on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.547#refinements of his art.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.548#“Never mind,” said the governor, good-naturedly, “I wish all our
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.549#employees to have good, abundant food. I'll speak to the cook.” And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.550#Mignot's complaint was shelved.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.551#Then returning to their point of departure, standing up near the door,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.552#amidst the umbrellas and neckties, Mouret and Bourdoncle received the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.553#report of one of the four inspectors, charged with the superintendence
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.554#of the establishment. Old Jouve, a retired captain, decorated at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.555#Constantine, a fine-looking man still, with his big sensual nose and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.556#majestic baldness, having drawn their attention to a salesman, who,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.557#in reply to a simple remonstrance on his part, had called him “an old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.558#humbug,” the salesman was immediately discharged.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.559#However, the shop was still without customers, except a few housewives
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.560#of the neighbourhood who were going through the almost deserted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.561#galleries. At the door the time-keeper had just closed his book, and was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.562#making out a separate list of the late comers. The salesmen were taking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.563#possession of their departments, which had been swept and brushed by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.564#the messengers before their arrival. Each young man hung up his hat
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.565#and great-coat as he arrived, stifling a yawn, still half asleep. Some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.566#exchanged a few words, gazed about the shop and seemed to be pulling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.567#themselves together ready for another day's work; others were leisurely
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.568#removing the green baize with which they had covered the goods over
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.569#night, after having folded them up; and the piles of stuffs appeared
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.570#symmetrically arranged, the whole shop was in a clean and orderly state,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.571#brilliant in the morning gaiety, waiting for the rush of business to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.572#come and obstruct it, and, as it were, narrow it by the unpacking and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.573#display of linen, cloth, silk, and lace.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.574#In the bright light of the central hall, two young men were talking in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.575#a low voice at the silk counter. One, short and charming, well set, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.576#with a pink skin, was endeavouring to blend the colours of some silks
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.577#for indoor show. His name was Hutin, his father kept a café at Yvetot,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.578#and he had managed after eighteen months' service to become one of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.579#principal salesmen, thanks to a natural flexibility of character,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.580#a continual flow of caressing flattery, under which was concealed a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.581#furious rage for business, grasping everything, devouring everybody,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.582#even without hunger, just for the pleasure of the thing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.583#“Look here, Favier, I should have struck him if I had been in your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.584#place, honour bright!” said he to the other, a tall bilious fellow with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.585#a dry and yellow skin, who was born at Besançon of a family of weavers,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.586#and who, without the least grace, concealed under a cold exterior a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.587#disquieting will.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.588#“It does no good to strike people,” murmured he, phlegmatically; “better
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.589#wait.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.590#They were both speaking of Robineau, who was looking after the shopmen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.591#during the manager's absence downstairs. Hutin was secretly undermining
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.592#Robineau, whose place he coveted. He had already, to wound him and make
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.593#him leave, introduced Bouthemont to fill the vacancy of manager which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.594#had been promised to Robineau. However, the latter stood firm, and it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.595#was now an hourly battle. Hutin dreamed of setting the whole department
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.596#against him, to hound him out by means of ill-will and vexations. At
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.597#the same time he went to work craftily, exciting Favier especially, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.598#stood next to him as salesman, and who appeared to allow himself to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.599#led on, but with certain brusque reserves, in which could be felt quite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.600#a private campaign carried on in silence.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.601#“Hush! seventeen!” said he, quickly, to his colleague, to warn him by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.602#this peculiar cry of the approach of Mouret and Bourdoncle.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.603#These latter were continuing their inspection by traversing the hall.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.604#They stopped to ask Robineau for an explanation with regard to a stock
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.605#of velvets of which the boxes were encumbering a table. And as the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.606#latter replied that there wasn't enough room:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.607#“I told you so, Bourdoncle,” cried out Mouret, smiling; “the place is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.608#already too small. We shall soon have to knock down the walls as far as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.609#the Rue de Choiseul. You'll see what a crush there'll be next Monday.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.610#And respecting the coming sale, for which they were preparing at every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.611#counter, he asked Robineau further questions and gave him various
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.612#orders. But for several minutes, and without having stopped talking, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.613#had been watching Hutin, who was contrasting the silks--blue, grey, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.614#yellow--drawing back to judge of the harmony of the tones. Suddenly he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.615#interfered:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.616#“But why are you endeavouring to please the eyes? Don't be afraid; blind
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.617#them. Look! red, green, yellow.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.618#He had taken the pieces, throwing them together, crushing them,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.619#producing an excessively fast effect. Every one allowed the governor to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.620#be the best displayer in Paris, of a regular revolutionary stamp, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.621#had founded the brutal and colossal school in the science of displaying.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.622#He delighted in a tumbling of stuffs, as if they had fallen from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.623#the crowded shelves by chance, making them glow with the most ardent
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.624#colours, lighting each other up by the contrast, declaring that the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.625#customers ought to have sore eyes on going out of the shop. Hutin, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.626#belonged, on the contrary, to the classic school, in which symmetry and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.627#harmony of colour were cherished, looked at him lighting up this fire of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.628#stuff on a table, not venturing on the least criticism, but biting his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.629#lip with the pout of an artist whose convictions are wounded by such a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.630#debauch.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.631#“There!” exclaimed Mouret when he had finished. “Leave it; you'll see if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.632#it doesn't fetch the women on Monday.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.633#Just as he rejoined Bourdoncle and Robineau, there arrived a woman, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.634#remained stock-still, suffocated before this show. It was Denise, who,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.635#having waited for nearly an hour in the street, the prey to a violent
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.636#attack of timidity, had at last decided to go in. But she was so beside
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.637#herself with bashfulness that she mistook the clearest directions; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.638#the shopmen, of whom she had stutteringly asked for Madame Aurélie,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.639#directed her in vain to the lower staircase; she thanked them, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.640#turned to the left if they told her to turn to the right; so that for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.641#the last ten minutes she had been wandering about the ground-floor,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.642#going from department to department, amidst the ill-natured curiosity
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.643#and ill-tempered indifference of the salesmen. She longed to run away,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.644#and was at the same time retained by a wish to stop and admire. She felt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.645#herself lost, she, so little, in this monster place, in this machine at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.646#rest, trembling for fear she should be caught in the movement with which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.647#the walls already began to shake. And the thought of The Old Elbeuf,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.648#black and narrow, increased the immensity of this vast establishment,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.649#presenting it to her as bathed in light, like a city with its monuments,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.650#squares, and streets, in which it seemed impossible that she should ever
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.651#find her way.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.652#However, she had not dared to risk herself in the silk hall, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.653#high glass roof, luxurious counters, and cathedral-like air of which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.654#frightened her. Then when she did venture in, to escape the shopmen in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.655#the linen department, who were grinning, she had stumbled right on to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.656#Mouret's display; and, notwithstanding her fright, the woman was aroused
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.657#within her, her cheeks suddenly became red, and she forgot everything in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.658#looking at the glow of these silks.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.659#“Hullo!” said Hutin in Favier's ear; “there's the girl we saw in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.660#Place Gaillon.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.661#Mouret, whilst affecting to listen to Bourdoncle and Robineau, was at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.662#heart flattered by the startled look of this poor girl, as a marchioness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.663#might be by the brutal desire of a passing drayman. But Denise had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.664#raised her eyes, and her confusion increased at the sight of this young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.665#man, whom she took for a manager. She thought he was looking at her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.666#severely. Then not knowing how to get away, quite lost, she applied to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.667#the nearest shopman, who happened to be Favier.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.668#“Madame Aurélie, please?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.669#But Favier, who was disagreeable, contented himself with replying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.670#sharply: “First floor.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.671#And Denise, longing to escape the looks of all these men, thanked him,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.672#and had again turned her back to the stairs she ought to have mounted,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.673#when Hutin, yielding naturally to his instinct of gallantry, stopped her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.674#with his most amiable salesman's smile, “No--this way, mademoiselle; if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.675#you don't mind.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.676#And he even went with her a little way to the foot of the staircase
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.677#on the left-hand side of the hall under the gallery. There he bowed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.678#smiling tenderly, as he smiled at all women.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.679#“When you get upstairs turn to the left. The dress department is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.680#straight in front.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.681#This caressing politeness affected Denise deeply. It was like a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.682#brotherly hand extended to her; she raised her eyes and looked at Hutin,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.683#and everything in him touched her--his handsome face, his looks which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.684#dissolved her fears, and his voice which seemed to her of a consoling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.685#softness. Her heart swelled with gratitude, and she bestowed her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.686#friendship in the few disjointed words her emotion allowed her to utter.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.687#“Really, sir, you are too kind. Pray don't trouble to come any further.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.688#Thank you very much.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.689#Hutin had already rejoined Favier, to whom he coarsely whispered: “What
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.690#a bag of bones--eh?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.691#Upstairs the young girl suddenly found herself in the midst of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.692#dress department. It was a vast room, with high carved oak cupboards all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.693#round, and clear glass windows looking on to the Rue de la Michodière.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.694#Five or six women in silk dresses, looking very coquettish with their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.695#frizzed chignons and crinolines drawn back, were moving about, talking.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.696#One, tall and thin, with a long head, having a runaway-horse appearance,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.697#was leaning against a cupboard, as if already knocked up with fatigue.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.698#“Madame Aurélie?” inquired Denise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.699#The saleswoman looked at her without replying, with an air of disdain
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.700#for her shabby dress, then turning to one of her friends, a short girl
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.701#with a sickly white skin and an innocent and disgusted appearance, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.702#asked: “Mademoiselle Vadon, do you know where Madame Aurélie is?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.703#The young girl, who was arranging some mantles according to their sizes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.704#did not even take the trouble to raise her head. “No, Mademoiselle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.705#Prunaire, I don't know at all,” replied she in a mincing tone.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.706#A silence ensued. Denise stood still, and no one took any further notice
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.707#of her. However, after waiting a moment, she ventured to put another
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.708#question: “Do you think Madame Aurélie will be back soon?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.709#The second-hand, a thin, ugly woman, whom she had not noticed before,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.710#a widow with a projecting jaw-bone and coarse hair, cried out from a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.711#cupboard, where she was checking some tickets: “You'd better wait if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.712#you want to speak to Madame Aurélie herself.” And, addressing another
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.713#saleswoman, she added: “Isn't she downstairs?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.714#“No, Madame Frédéric, I don't think so,” replied the young lady. “She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.715#said nothing before going, so she can't be far off.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.716#Denise, thus instructed, remained standing. There were several chairs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.717#for the customers; but as they had not told her to sit down, she did
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.718#not dare to take one, although she felt ready to drop with fatigue. All
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.719#these ladies had evidently put her down as an applicant for the vacancy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.720#and they were taking stock of her, pulling her to pieces ill-naturedly,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.721#with the secret hostility of people at table who do not like to close up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.722#to make room for hungry outsiders. Her confusion increased; she crossed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.723#the room quietly and looked out of the window into the street, just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.724#for something to do. Opposite, The Old Elbeuf, with its rusty front and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.725#lifeless windows, appeared to her so ugly, so miserable, seen thus from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.726#amidst the luxury and life of her present standpoint, that a sort of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.727#remorse filled her already swollen heart with grief.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.728#“I say,” whispered tall Prunaire to little Vadon, “have you seen her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.729#boots?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.730#“And her dress!” murmured the other.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.731#With her eyes still towards the street, Denise felt herself being
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.732#devoured. But she was not angry; she did not think them handsome,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.733#neither the tall one with her carroty chignon falling over her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.734#horse-like neck, nor the little one with her sour milk complexion, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.735#gave her flat and, as it were, boneless face a flabby appearance. Clara
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.736#Primaire, daughter of a clogmaker in the forest of Vilet, debauched by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.737#the footmen at the Château de Mareuil, where the countess engaged her as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.738#needlewoman, had come later on from a shop at Langres, and was avenging
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.739#herself in Paris on the men for the kicks with which her father had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.740#regaled her when at home. Marguerite Vadon, born at Grenoble, where
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.741#her parents kept a linen shop, had been obliged to come to The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.742#Paradise to conceal an accident she had met with--a brat which had made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.743#its appearance one day. She was a well-conducted girl, and intended
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.744#to return to Grenoble to take charge of her parents' shop, and marry a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.745#cousin who was waiting for her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.746#“Well,” resumed Clara, in a low voice, “there's a girl who won't do much
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.747#good here!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.748#But they stopped talking. A woman of about forty-five came in. It was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.749#Madame Aurélie, very stout, tightly laced in her black silk dress, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.750#body of which, strained over her massive shoulders and full bust, shone
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.751#like a piece of armour. She had, under very dark folds of hair, great
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.752#fixed eyes, a severe mouth, and large and rather drooping cheeks; and in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.753#the majesty of her position as first-hand, her face assumed the bombast
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.754#of a puffy mask of Cæsar, “Mademoiselle Vadon,” said she, in an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.755#irritated voice, “you didn't return the pattern of that mantle to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.756#workroom yesterday, it seems?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.757#“There was an alteration to make, madame,” replied the saleswoman, “so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.758#Madame Frédéric kept it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.759#The second-hand then took the pattern out of a cupboard, and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.760#explanation continued. Every one gave way to Madame Aurélie, when she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.761#thought it necessary to assert her authority. Very vain, even going so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.762#far as not to wish to be called by her real name, Lhomme, which annoyed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.763#her, and to deny her father's humble position, always referring to him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.764#as a regularly established tailor, she was only gracious towards those
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.765#young ladies who showed themselves flexible and caressing, bowing down
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.766#in admiration before her. Some time previously, whilst she was trying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.767#to establish herself in a shop of her own, her temper had become sour,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.768#continually thwarted by the worst of luck, exasperated to feel herself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.769#born to fortune and to encounter nothing but a series of catastrophes;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.770#and now, even after her success at The Ladies' Paradise, where she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.771#earned twelve thousand francs a year, it seemed that she still nourished
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.772#a secret spite against every one, and she was very hard with beginners,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.773#as life had shown itself hard for her at first.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.774#“That will do!” said she, sharply; “you are no more reasonable than the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.775#others, Madame Frédéric. Let the alteration be made immediately.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.776#During this explanation, Denise had ceased to look into the street
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.777#She had no doubt this was Madame Aurélie; but, frightened at her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.778#sharp voice, she remained standing, still waiting. The two saleswomen,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.779#delighted to have set their two superiors at variance, had returned to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.780#their work with an air of profound indifference. A few minutes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.781#elapsed, nobody being charitable enough to draw the young girl from her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.782#uncomfortable position. At last, Madame Aurélie herself perceived her,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.783#and astonished to see her standing there without moving, asked her what
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.784#she wanted.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.785#“Madame Aurélie, please.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.786#“I am Madame Aurélie.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.787#Denise's mouth became dry and parched, and her hands cold; she felt some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.788#such fear as when she was a child and trembled at the thought of being
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.789#whipped. She stammered out her request, but was obliged to repeat it to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.790#make herself understood. Madame Aurélie looked at her with her great
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.791#fixed eyes, not a line of her imperial mask deigning to relax, “How old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.792#are you?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.793#“Twenty, madame.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.794#“What, twenty years old? you don't look sixteen!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.795#The saleswomen again raised their heads. Denise hastened to add: “Oh,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.796#I'm very strong!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.797#Madame Aurélie shrugged her broad shoulders, then coldly declared:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.798#“Well! I don't mind entering your name. We enter the names of all those
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.799#who apply. Mademoiselle Prunaire, give me the book.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.800#But the book could not be found; Jouve, the inspector had probably got
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.801#it. As tall Clara was going to fetch it, Mouret arrived, still followed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.802#by Bourdoncle. They had made the tour of the other departments--the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.803#lace, the shawls, the furs, the furniture, the under-linen, and were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.804#winding up with the dresses. Madame Aurélie left Denise a moment to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.805#speak to them about an order for some cloaks she thought of giving to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.806#one of the large Paris houses; as a rule, she bought direct, and on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.807#her own responsibility; but, for important purchases, she preferred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.808#consulting the chiefs of the house. Bourdoncle then related her son
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.809#Albert's latest act of carelessness, which seemed to fill her with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.810#despair. That boy would kill her; his father, although not a man of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.811#talent, was at least well-conducted, careful, and honest. All this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.812#dynasty of Lhommes, of which she was the acknowledged head, very often
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.813#caused her a great deal of trouble. However, Mouret, surprised to see
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.814#Denise again, bent down to ask Madame Aurélie what the young lady was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.815#doing there; and, when the first-hand replied that she was applying for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.816#a saleswoman's situation, Bourdoncle, with his disdain for women, seemed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.817#suffocated at this pretension.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.818#“You don't mean it,” murmured he; “it must be a joke, she's too ugly!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.819#“The fact is, there's nothing handsome about her,” said Mouret, not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.820#daring to defend her, although still moved by the rapture she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.821#displayed downstairs before his arrangement of silks.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.822#But the book having been brought in, Madame Aurélie returned to Denise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.823#who had certainly not made a favourable impression. She looked very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.824#clean in her thin black woollen dress; the question of shabbiness was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.825#of no importance, as the house furnished a uniform, the regulation silk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.826#dress; but she appeared rather weak and puny, and had a melancholy face.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.827#Without insisting on handsome girls, one liked them to be of agreeable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.828#appearance for the sale rooms. And beneath the gaze of all these ladies
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.829#and gentlemen who were studying her, weighing her like farmers would a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.830#horse at a fair, Denise completely lost countenance.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.831#“Your name?” asked Madame Aurélie, at the end of a counter, pen in hand,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.832#ready to write.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.833#“Denise Baudu, madame.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.834#“Your age?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.835#“Twenty years and four months.” And she repeated, risking a glance at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.836#Mouret, at this supposed manager, whom she met everywhere and whose
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.837#presence troubled her so: “I don't look like it, but I am really very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.838#strong.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.839#They smiled. Bourdoncle showed evident signs of impatience; her remark
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.840#fell, moreover, amidst a most discouraging silence.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.841#“What house have you been in, in Paris?” resumed Madame Aurélie.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.842#“I've just arrived from Valognes.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.843#This was a fresh disaster. As a rule, The Ladies' Paradise only took
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.844#saleswomen with a year's experience in one of the small houses in Paris.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.845#Denise thought all was lost; and, had it not been for the children,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.846#had she not been obliged to work for them, she would have closed this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.847#useless interview and left the place. “Where were you at Valognes?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.848#“At Cornaille's.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.849#“I know him--good house,” remarked Mouret.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.850#It was very rarely that he interfered in the engagement of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.851#employees, the manager of each department being responsible for his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.852#staff. But with his delicate appreciation of women, he divined in this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.853#young girl a hidden charm, a wealth of grace, and tenderness of which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.854#she herself was ignorant. The good name enjoyed by the house in which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.855#the candidate had started was of great importance, often deciding the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.856#question in his or her favour. Madame Aurélie continued, in a kinder
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.857#tone: “And why did you leave Cornaille's?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.858#“For family reasons,” replied Denise, turning scarlet “We have lost
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.859#our parents, I have been obliged to follow my brothers. Here is a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.860#certificate.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.861#It was excellent Her hopes were reviving, when another question troubled
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.862#her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.863#“Have you any other references in Paris? Where do you live?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.864#“At my uncle's,” murmured she, hesitating about naming him, fearing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.865#they would never take the niece of a competitor. “At my uncle Baudu's,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.866#opposite.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.867#At this, Mouret interfered a second time. “What! are you Baudu's niece?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.868#Is it Baudu who sent you here?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.869#“Oh! no, sir!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.870#And she could not help laughing, the idea appeared to her so singular.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.871#It was a transfiguration; she became quite rosy, and the smile round
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.872#her rather large mouth lighted up her whole face. Her grey eyes sparkled
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.873#with a tender flame, her cheeks filled with delicious dimples, and even
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.874#her light hair seemed to partake of the frank and courageous gaiety that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.875#pervaded her whole being.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.876#“Why, she's really pretty,” whispered Mouret to Bourdoncle.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.877#The partner refused to admit it, with a gesture of annoyance. Clara
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.878#bit her lips, and Marguerite turned away; but Madame Aurélie seemed won
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.879#over, and encouraged Mouret with a nod when he resumed: “Your uncle was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.880#wrong not to bring you; his recommendation sufficed. They say he has a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.881#grudge against us. We are people of more liberal minds, and if he can't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.882#find employment for his niece in his house, why we will show him that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.883#she has only to knock at our door to be received. Just tell him I still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.884#like him very much, and that he must blame, not me, but the new style
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.885#of business. Tell him, too, that he will ruin himself if he insists on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.886#keeping to his ridiculous old-fashioned ways.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.887#Denise turned quite white again. It was Mouret; no one had mentioned his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.888#name, but he had revealed himself, and now she guessed who it was, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.889#understood why this young man had caused her such emotion in the street,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.890#in the silk department, and again now. This emotion, which she could not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.891#analyse, pressed on her heart more and more, like a too-heavy weight.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.892#All the stories related by her uncle came back to her, increasing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.893#Mouret's importance, surrounding him with a sort of halo, making of him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.894#the master of the terrible machine by whose wheels she had felt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.895#herself being seized all the morning. And, behind his handsome face,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.896#well-trimmed beard, and eyes of the colour of old gold, she beheld the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.897#dead woman, that Madame Hédouin, whose blood had helped to cement the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.898#stones of the house. The shiver she had felt the previous night again
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.899#seized her; and she thought she was merely afraid of him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.900#Meanwhile, Madame Aurélie had closed the book. She only wanted one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.901#saleswoman, and she already had ten applications. But she was too
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.902#anxious to please the governor to hesitate for a moment. However, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.903#application would follow its course, Jouve, the inspector, would go
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.904#and make enquiries, send in his report, and then she would come to a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.905#decision.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.906#“Very good, mademoiselle,” said she majestically, to preserve her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.907#authority; “we will write to you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.908#Denise stood there, unable to move for a moment, hardly knowing how to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.909#take her leave in the midst of all these people. At last she thanked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.910#Madame Aurélie, and on passing by Mouret and Bourdoncle, she bowed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.911#These gentlemen, occupied in examining the pattern of a mantle with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.912#Madame Frédéric, did not take the slightest notice. Clara looked in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.913#vexed way towards Marguerite, as if to predict that the new comer would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.914#not have a very pleasant time of it in the place. Denise doubtless felt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.915#this indifference and rancour behind her, for she went downstairs with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.916#the same troubled feeling she had on going up, asking herself whether
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.917#she ought to be sorry or glad to have come. Could she count on having
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.918#the situation? She did not even know that, her uncomfortable state
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.919#having prevented her understanding clearly. Of all her sensations, two
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.920#remained and gradually effaced all the others--the emotion, almost
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.921#the fear, inspired in her by Mouret, and Hutin's amiability, the only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.922#pleasure she had enjoyed the whole morning, a souvenir of charming
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.923#sweetness which filled her with gratitude. When she crossed the shop to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.924#go out she looked for the young man, happy at the idea of thanking him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.925#again with her eyes; and she was very sorry not to see him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.926#“Well, mademoiselle, have you succeeded?” asked a timid voice, as she at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.927#last stood on the pavement outside. She turned round and recognised the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.928#tall, awkward young fellow who had spoken to her in the morning. He also
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.929#had just come out of The Ladies' Paradise, appearing more frightened
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.930#than she did, still bewildered with the examination he had just passed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.931#through.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.932#“I really don't know yet, sir,” replied she.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.933#“You're like me, then. What a way of looking at and talking to you they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.934#have in there--eh? I'm applying for a place in the lace department I was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.935#at Crèvecour's in the Rue du Mail.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.936#They were once more standing facing each other; and, not knowing how
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.937#to take leave, they commenced to blush. Then the young man, just for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.938#something to say in the excess of his timidity, ventured to ask in his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.939#good-natured, awkward way: “What is your name, mademoiselle?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.940#“Denise Baudu.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.941#“My name is Henri Deloche.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.942#Now they smiled, and, yielding to the fraternity of their positions,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.943#shook each other by the hand.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.944#“Good luck!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ii.945#“Yes, good luck!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.1#CHAPTER III.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.2#Every Saturday, between four and six, Madame Desforges offered a cup of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.3#tea and a few cakes to those friends who were kind enough to visit her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.4#She occupied the third floor of a house at the corner of the Rue de
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.5#Rivoli and the Rue d'Alger; and the windows of both drawing-rooms
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.6#overlooked the Tuileries Gardens. This Saturday, just as a footman was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.7#about to introduce him into the principal drawing-room, Mouret perceived
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.8#from the anteroom, through an open door, Madame Desforges, who was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.9#crossing the little drawing-room. She stopped on seeing him, and he went
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.10#in that way, bowing to her with a ceremonious air. But when the footman
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.11#had closed the door, he quickly seized the young woman's hand, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.12#tenderly kissed it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.13#“Take care, I have company!” she said, in a low voice, glancing towards
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.14#the door of the larger room. “I've just been to fetch this fan to show
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.15#them,” and she playfully tapped him on the face with the tip of the fan.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.16#She was dark, rather stout, with big jealous eyes.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.17#But he still held her hand and asked: “Will he come?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.18#“Certainly,” replied she. “I have his promise.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.19#Both of them referred to Baron Hartmann, director of the Credit
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.20#Immobilier. Madame Desforges, daughter of a Councillor of State, was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.21#the widow of a stock-broker, who had left her a fortune, denied by some,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.22#exaggerated by others. Even during her husband's lifetime people said
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.23#she had shown herself grateful towards Baron Hartmann, whose financial
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.24#tips had proved very useful to them; and later on, after her husband's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.25#death, the acquaintance had probably continued, but always discreetly,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.26#without imprudence or display; for she never courted notoriety in any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.27#way, and was received everywhere in the upper-middle classes amongst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.28#whom she was born. Even at this time, when the passion of the banker, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.29#sceptical, crafty man, had subsided into a simple paternal affection, if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.30#she permitted herself certain lovers whom he tolerated, she displayed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.31#in these treasons of the heart such a delicate reserve and tact, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.32#knowledge of the world so adroitly applied, that appearances were saved,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.33#and no one would have ventured to openly express any doubt as to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.34#her conduct Having met Mouret at a mutual friend's, she had at first
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.35#detested him; but she had yielded to him later on, as if carried away by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.36#the violent love with which he attacked her, and since he had commenced
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.37#to approach Baron Hartmann through her, she had gradually got to love
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.38#him with a real profound tenderness, adoring him with the violence of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.39#woman already thirty-five, although only acknowledging twenty-nine,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.40#and in despair at feeling him younger than herself, trembling lest she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.41#should lose him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.42#“Does he know about it?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.43#“No, you'll explain the affair to him yourself,” she replied.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.44#She looked at him, thinking that he couldn't know anything or he would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.45#not employ her in this way with the baron, affecting to consider him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.46#simply as an old friend of hers. But he still held her hand, he called
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.47#her his good Henriette, and she felt her heart melting. Silently she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.48#presented her lips, pressed them to his, then whispered: “Oh, they're
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.49#waiting for me. Come in behind me.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.50#They could hear voices issuing from the principal drawingroom, deadened
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.51#by the heavy curtains. She pushed the door, leaving its two folds open,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.52#and handed the fan to one of the four ladies who were seated in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.53#middle of the room.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.54#“There it is,” said she; “I didn't know exactly where it was. My maid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.55#would never have found it.” And she added in her cheerful way: “Come in,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.56#Monsieur Mouret, come through the little drawing-room; it will be less
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.57#solemn.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.58#Mouret bowed to the ladies whom he knew. The drawingroom, with its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.59#flowered brocatel Louis XVI. furniture, gilded bronzes and large green
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.60#plants, had a tender feminine air, notwithstanding the height of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.61#ceiling; and through the two windows could be seen the chestnut trees in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.62#the Tuileries Gardens, their leaves blowing about in the October wind.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.63#“But it isn't at all bad, this Chantilly!” exclaimed Madame Bourdelais,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.64#who had taken the fan.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.65#She was a short fair woman of thirty, with a delicate nose and sparkling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.66#eyes, an old school-fellow of Henriette's, and who had married a chief
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.67#clerk in the Treasury. Of an old middle-class family, she managed her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.68#household and three children with a rare activity and good grace, and an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.69#exquisite knowledge of practical life.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.70#“And you paid twenty-five francs for it?” resumed she, examining each
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.71#mesh of the lace. “At Luc, I think you said, to a country woman? No, it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.72#isn't dear; but you had to get it mounted, hadn't you?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.73#“Of course,” replied Madame Desforges. “The mounting cost me two hundred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.74#francs.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.75#Madame Bourdelais began to laugh. And that was what Henriette called a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.76#bargain! Two hundred francs for a plain ivory mount, with a monogram!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.77#And that for a simple piece of Chantilly, over which she had saved five
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.78#francs, perhaps. Similar fans could be had ready, mounted for a hundred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.79#and twenty francs, and she named a shop in the Rue Poissonnière.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.80#However, the fan was handed round to all the ladies. Madame Guibal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.81#barely glanced at it. She was a tall, thin woman, with red hair, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.82#a face full of indifference, in which her grey eyes, occasionally
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.83#penetrating her unconcerned air, cast the terrible gleams of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.84#selfishness. She was never seen out with her husband, a barrister
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.85#well-known at the Palais de Justice, who led, it was said, a pretty free
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.86#life, dividing himself between his law business and his pleasures.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.87#“Oh,” murmured she, passing the fan to Madame de Boves, “I've scarcely
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.88#bought one in my life. One always receives too many of such things.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.89#The countess replied with delicate malice: “You are fortunate, my dear,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.90#in having a gallant husband.” And bending over to her daughter, a tall
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.91#girl of twenty, she added: “Just look at the monogram, Blanche. What
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.92#pretty work! It's the monogram that must have increased the price like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.93#that.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.94#Madame de Boves had just turned forty. She was a superb woman, with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.95#neck of a goddess, a large regular face, and big sleepy eyes, whom her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.96#husband, Inspector-General of the Stud, had married for her beauty. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.97#appeared quite moved by the delicacy of the monogram, as if seized with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.98#a desire the emotion of which made her turn pale, and turning round
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.99#suddenly, she continued: “Give us your opinion, Monsieur Mouret. Is it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.100#too dear--two hundred francs for this mount?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.101#Mouret had remained standing in the midst of the five women, smiling,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.102#taking an interest in what interested them. He picked up the fan,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.103#examined it, and was about to give his opinion, when the footman opened
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.104#the door and announced:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.105#“Madame Marty.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.106#And there entered a thin, ugly woman, ravaged with the small-pox,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.107#dressed with a complicated elegance. She was of uncertain age, her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.108#thirty-five years appearing sometimes equal to thirty, and sometimes to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.109#forty, according to the intensity of the nervous fever which agitated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.110#her. A red leather bag, which she had not let go, hung from her right
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.111#hand.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.112#“Dear madame,” said she to Henriette, “excuse me bringing my bag. Just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.113#fancy, as I was coming along I went into The Paradise, and as I have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.114#again been very extravagant, I did not like to leave it in my cab
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.115#for fear of being robbed.” But having perceived Mouret, she resumed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.116#laughingly: “Ah! sir, I didn't mean to give you an advertisement, for I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.117#didn't know you were here. But you really have some extraordinary fine
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.118#lace just now.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.119#This turned the attention from the fan, which the young man laid on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.120#table. The ladies were all anxious to see what Madame Marty had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.121#bought. She was known to be very extravagant, totally unable to resist
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.122#temptation, strict in her conduct and incapable of yielding to a lover,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.123#but weak and cowardly, easily conquered before the least bit of finery.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.124#Daughter of a city clerk, she was ruining her husband, a master at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.125#Lycée Bonaparte, who was obliged to double his salary of six thousand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.126#francs a year by giving private lessons, in order to meet the constantly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.127#increasing household expenses. She did not open her bag, but held it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.128#tight on her lap, and commenced to talk about her daughter Valentine,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.129#fourteen years old, one of her dearest coquetries, for she dressed her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.130#like herself, with all the fashionable novelties of which she submitted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.131#to the irresistible seduction.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.132#“You know,” she said, “they are making dresses trimmed with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.133#narrow lace for young girls this winter. So when I saw%a very pretty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.134#Valenciennes----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.135#And she at last decided to open her bag. The ladies were stretching out
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.136#their necks, when, in the midst of the silence, the door-bell was heard.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.137#“It's my husband,” stammered Madame Marty, very confused. “He promised to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.138#fetch me on leaving the Lycée Bonaparte.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.139#She quickly shut the bag again, and put it under her chair with an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.140#instinctive movement. All the ladies set up a laugh. This made her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.141#blush for her precipitation, and she put the bag on her knees again,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.142#explaining that men never understood, and that they need not know.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.143#“Monsieur de Boves, Monsieur de Vallagnosc,” announced the footman.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.144#It was quite a surprise. Madame de Boves herself did not expect her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.145#husband. The latter, a fine man, wearing a moustache and an imperial
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.146#with the military correctness so much liked at the Tuileries, kissed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.147#the hand of Madame Desforges, whom he had known as a young girl at her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.148#father's. And he made way to allow his companion, a tall, pale fellow,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.149#of an aristocratic poverty of blood, to make his bow to the lady of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.150#house. But the conversation had hardly recommenced when two exclamations
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.151#were heard:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.152#“What! Is that you, Paul?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.153#“Why, Octave!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.154#Mouret and Vallagnosc then shook hands, much to Madame Desforges's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.155#surprise. They knew each other, then? Of course, they had grown up side
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.156#by side at the college at Plassans, and it was quite by chance they had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.157#not met at her house before. However, with their hands still united,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.158#they went into the little drawing-room, just as the servant brought in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.159#the tea, a china service on a silver waiter, which he placed near Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.160#Desforges, on a small round marble table with a light copper mounting.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.161#The ladies drew up and began talking louder, all speaking at once,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.162#producing a cross-fire of short disjointed sentences; whilst Monsieur
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.163#de Boves, standing up behind them, put in an occasional word with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.164#gallantry of a handsome functionary. The vast room, so prettily and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.165#cheerfully furnished, became merrier still with these gossiping voices,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.166#and the frequent laughter.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.167#“Ah! Paul, old boy,” repeated Mouret.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.168#He was seated near Vallagnosc, on a sofa. And alone in the little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.169#drawing-room, very coquettish with its pretty silk hangings, out of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.170#hearing of the ladies, and not even seeing them, except through the open
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.171#door, the two old friends commenced grinning, examining each other's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.172#looks, exchanging slaps on the knees. Their whole youthful career was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.173#recalled, the old college at Plassans, with its two courtyards, its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.174#damp classrooms, and the dining-room in which they had consumed so much
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.175#cod-fish, and the dormitories where the pillows used to fly from bed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.176#to bed as soon as the monitor began to snore. Paul, belonging to an old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.177#parliamentary family, noble, poor, and proud, was a good scholar,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.178#always at the top of his class, continually held up as an example by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.179#the master, who prophesied for him a brilliant future; whilst Octave
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.180#remained at the bottom, stuck amongst the dunces, fat and jolly,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.181#indulging in all sorts of pleasures outside. Notwithstanding the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.182#difference in their characters, a fast friendship had rendered them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.183#inseparable, until their final examinations, which they passed, the one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.184#with honours, the other in a passable manner after two vexatious trials.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.185#Then they went out into the world, and had now met again, after ten
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.186#years, already changed and looking older.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.187#“Well,” said Mouret, “what's become of you?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.188#“Nothing at all,” replied the other.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.189#Vallagnosc, in the joy of their meeting, retained his tired and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.190#disenchanted air; and as his friend, astonished, insisted, saying: “But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.191#you must do something. What do you do?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.192#“Nothing,” replied he.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.193#Octave commenced to laugh. Nothing! that wasn't enough. Little by little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.194#he succeeded in drawing Paul out to tell his story. It was the usual
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.195#story of penniless younger sons, who think themselves obliged by their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.196#birth to choose a liberal profession, burying themselves in a sort
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.197#of vain mediocrity, happy to escape starvation, notwithstanding their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.198#numerous degrees. He had studied law by a sort of family tradition; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.199#had since remained a burden on his widowed mother, who even then hardly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.200#knew how to dispose of her two daughters. Having at last got quite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.201#ashamed, he left the three women to vegetate on the remnants of their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.202#fortune, and accepted an appointment in the Ministry of the Interior,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.203#where he buried himself like a mole in its hole.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.204#“What do you get there?” resumed Mouret.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.205#“Three thousand francs.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.206#“But that's pitiful pay! Ah! old man, I'm really sorry for you. What! a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.207#clever fellow like you, who floored all of us I And they only give you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.208#three thousand francs a year, after having already ground you down for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.209#five years! No, it isn't right!” He interrupted himself, and returned to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.210#his own doings. “As for me, I made them a humble bow. You know what I'm
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.211#doing?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.212#“Yes,” said Vallagnosc, “I heard you were in business. You've got that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.213#big place in the Place Gaillon, haven't you?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.214#“That's it. Counter-jumper, my boy!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.215#Mouret raised his head, again slapped him on the knee, and repeated,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.216#with the solid gaiety of a fellow who did not blush for the trade by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.217#which he was making his fortune:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.218#“Counter-jumper, and no mistake! You remember, no doubt, I didn't bite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.219#much at their machines, although at heart I never thought myself duller
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.220#than the others. When I took my degree, just to please the family, I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.221#could have become a barrister or a doctor quite as easily as any of my
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.222#school-fellows, but those trades frightened me. I saw so many who were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.223#starving at them that I just threw them over without the least regret,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.224#and pitched head-first into business.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.225#Vallognosc smiled with an awkward air, and ultimately said: “It's very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.226#certain your degree can't be much good to you for selling calico.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.227#“Well!” replied Mouret, joyously, “all I ask is, that it shall not stand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.228#in my way, and you know, when one has been stupid enough to burden one's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.229#self with it, it is difficult to get rid of it. One goes at a tortoise's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.230#pace through life, whilst those who are bare-footed run like madmen.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.231# Then, noticing that his friend seemed troubled, he took his hand in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.232#his, and continued: “Come, come, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.233#confess that your degrees have not satisfied any of your wants. Do you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.234#know that my manager in the silk department will draw more than twelve
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.235#thousand francs this year. Just so! a fellow of very clear intelligence,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.236#whose knowledge is confined to spelling, and the first four rules. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.237#ordinary salesmen in my place make from three to four thousand francs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.238#a year, more than you can earn yourself; and their education was not so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.239#expensive as yours, nor were they launched into the world with a written
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.240#promise to conquer it. Of course, it is not everything to make money;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.241#but between the poor devils possessed of a smattering of science who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.242#now block up the liberal professions, without earning enough to keep
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.243#themselves from starving, and the practical fellows armed for life's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.244#struggle, knowing every branch of their trade, by Jove! I don't hesitate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.245#a moment, I'm for the latter against the former, I think they thoroughly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.246#understand the age they live in!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.247#His voice had become impassioned. Henriette, who was pouring out the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.248#tea, turned her head. When he caught her smile, at the further end of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.249#the large drawing-room, and saw the other ladies were listening, he was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.250#the first to make merry over his own big phrases.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.251#“In short, old man, every counter-jumper who commences, has, at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.252#present day, a chance of becoming a millionaire.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.253#Vallagnosc threw himself back on the sofa indolently, half-closing his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.254#eyes in a fatigued and disdainful attitude, in which a suspicion of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.255#affectation was added to his real hereditary exhaustion.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.256#“Bah!” murmured he, “life isn't worth all that trouble. There is nothing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.257#worth living for.” And as Mouret, shocked, looked at him with an air of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.258#surprise, he added: “Everything happens and nothing happens; one may as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.259#well stay with one's arms folded.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.260#He then explained his pessimism--the mediocrities and the abortions of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.261#existence. For a time he had thought of literature, but his intercourse
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.262#with certain poets had filled him with universal despair. He always
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.263#arrived at the conclusion that all effort was useless, every hour
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.264#equally weary and empty, and the world incurably stupid and dull. All
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.265#enjoyment was a failure, and there was no pleasure in wrong-doing even.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.266#“Just tell me, do you enjoy life yourself?” asked he at last.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.267#Mouret was now in a state of astonished indignation, and exclaimed:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.268#“What? Do I enjoy myself? What are you talking about? Why, of course
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.269#I do, my boy, and even when things give way, for then I am furious at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.270#hearing them cracking. I am a passionate fellow myself, and don't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.271#take life quietly; that's what interests me in it perhaps.” He glanced
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.272#towards the drawing-room, and lowered his voice. “Oh! there are some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.273#women who've bothered me awfully, I must confess. But when I've got hold
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.274#of one, I keep her. She doesn't always escape me, and then I take my
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.275#share, I assure you. But it is not so much the women, for to speak
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.276#truly, I don't care a hang for them; it's the wish to act--to create, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.277#short. You have an idea; you fight for it, you hammer it into people's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.278#heads, and you see it grow and triumph. Ah! yes, my boy, I enjoy life!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.279#All the joy of action, all the gaiety of existence, resounded in these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.280#words. He repeated that he went with the times. Really, a man must be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.281#badly constituted, have his brain and limbs out of order, to refuse to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.282#work in an age of such vast undertakings, when the entire century was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.283#pressing forward with giant strides. And he laughed at the despairing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.284#ones, the disgusted ones, the pessimists, all those weak, sickly members
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.285#of our budding sciences, who assumed the weeping airs of poets, or the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.286#mincing ways of sceptics, amidst the immense activity of the present
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.287#day. A fine part to play, proper and intelligent, that of yawning before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.288#other people's labour!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.289#“That's my only pleasure, yawning in other's faces,” said Vallagnosc,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.290#smiling with his cold look.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.291#At this Mouret's passion subsided, and he became affectionate again.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.292#“Ah, Paul, you're not changed. Just as paradoxical as ever! However,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.293#we've not met to quarrel. Each one has his own ideas, fortunately. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.294#you must come and see my machine at work; you'll see it isn't a bad
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.295#idea. Come, what news? Your mother and sisters are quite well, I hope?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.296#And weren't you supposed to get married at Plassans, about six months
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.297#ago?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.298#A sudden movement made by Vallagnosc stopped him; and as the former was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.299#looking round the drawing-room with an anxious expression, Mouret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.300#also turned round, and noticed that Mademoiselle de Boves was closely
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.301#watching them. Blanche, tall and stout, resembled her mother; but her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.302#face was already puffed out, her large, coarse features swollen with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.303#unhealthy fat. Paul, in reply to a discreet question, intimated that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.304#nothing was yet settled; perhaps nothing would be settled. He had made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.305#the young person's acquaintance at Madame Desforges's, where he had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.306#visited a good deal last winter, but where he very rarely came now,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.307#which explained why he had not met Octave there sooner. In their turn,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.308#the De Boves invited him, and he was especially fond of the father, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.309#very amiable man, formerly well known about town, who had retired into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.310#his present position. On the other hand, no money. Madame de Boves
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.311#having brought her husband nothing but her Juno-like beauty as a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.312#marriage portion, the family were living poorly on the last mortgaged
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.313#farm, to which modest revenue was added, fortunately, the nine thousand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.314#francs a year drawn by the count as Inspector-General of the Stud.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.315#And the ladies, mother and daughter, kept very short of money by him,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.316#impoverished by tender escapades outside, were sometimes reduced to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.317#turning their dresses themselves.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.318#“In that case, why marry?” was Mouret's simple question.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.319#“Well! I can't go on like this for ever,” said Vallagnosc, with a weary
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.320#movement of the eyelids. “Besides, there are certain expectations; we
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.321#are waiting the death of an aunt.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.322#However, Mouret still kept his eye on Monsieur de Boves, who, seated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.323#next to Madame Guibal, was most attentive, and laughing tenderly like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.324#a man on an amorous campaign; he turned to his friend with such a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.325#significant twinkle of the eye that the latter added:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.326#“Not that one. At least not yet. The misfortune is, that his duty calls
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.327#him to the four corners of France, to the breeding dépôts, so that he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.328#has continual pretexts for absenting himself. Last month, whilst his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.329#wife supposed him to be at Perpignan, he was living at an hotel, in an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.330#out-of-the-way neighbourhood, with a music-mistress.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.331#There ensued a pause. Then the young man, who was also watching the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.332#count's gallantries towards Madame Guibal, resumed in a low tone:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.333#“Really, I think you are right. The more so as the dear lady is not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.334#exactly a saint, if all they say is true. There's a very amusing story
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.335#about her and an officer. But just look at him! Isn't he comical,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.336#magnetising her with his eyes? The old-fashioned gallantry, my dear
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.337#fellow! I adore that man, and if I marry his daughter, he can safely say
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.338#it's for his sake!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.339#Mouret laughed, greatly amused. He questioned Vallagnosc again, and when
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.340#he found that the first idea of a marriage between him and Blanche came
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.341#from Madame Desforges, he thought the story better still. That good
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.342#Henriette took a widow's delight in marrying people, so much so, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.343#when she had provided for the girls, she sometimes allowed their fathers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.344#to choose friends from her company; but all so naturally, with such a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.345#good grace, that no one ever found any food for scandal. And Mouret, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.346#loved her with the love of an active, busy man, accustomed to reducing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.347#his tenderness to figures, forgot all his calculations of captivation,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.348#and felt for her a comrade's friendship.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.349#At that moment she appeared at the door of the little drawing-room,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.350#followed by a gentleman, about sixty years old, whose entry had not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.351#been observed by the two friends. Occasionally the ladies' voices became
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.352#sharper, accompanied by the tinkling of the small spoons in the china
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.353#cups; and there was heard, from time to time, in the interval of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.354#short silence, the noise of a saucer laid down too roughly on the marble
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.355#table. A sudden gleam of the setting sun, which had just emerged from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.356#behind a thick cloud, gilded the top of the chestnut-trees in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.357#gardens, and streamed through the windows in a red, golden flame, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.358#fire of which lighted up the brocatel and brass-work of the furniture.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.359#“This way, my dear baron,” said Madame Desforges. “Allow me to introduce
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.360#Monsieur Octave Mouret, who is longing to express the admiration he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.361#feels for you.” And turning round towards Octave, she added: “Baron
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.362#Hartmann.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.363#[Illustration: 0077]
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.364#A smile played on the old man's lips. He was a short, vigorous man, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.365#a large Alsatian head, and a heavy face, which lighted up with a gleam
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.366#of intelligence at the slightest curl of his mouth, the slightest
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.367#movement of his eyelids. For the last fortnight he had resisted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.368#Henriette's wish that he should consent to this interview; not that he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.369#felt any immoderate jealousy, accepting, like a man of the world, his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.370#position of father; but because it was the third friend Henriette had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.371#introduced to him, and he was afraid of becoming ridiculous at last.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.372#So that on approaching Octave he put on the discreet smile of a rich
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.373#protector, who, if good enough to show himself charming, does not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.374#consent to be a dupe.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.375#“Oh! sir,” said Mouret, with his Southern enthusiasm, “the Credit
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.376#Immobiliers last operation was really astonishing! You cannot think how
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.377#happy and proud I am to know you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.378#“Too kind, sir, too kind,” repeated the baron, still smiling.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.379#Henriette looked at them with her clear eyes without any awkwardness,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.380#standing between the two, lifting her head, going from one to the other;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.381#and, in her lace dress, which revealed her delicate neck and wrists, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.382#appeared delighted to see them so friendly together.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.383#“Gentlemen,” said she at last, “I leave you to your conversation.” Then,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.384#turning towards Paul, who had got up, she resumed: “Will you accept of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.385#cup of tea, Monsieur de Vallagnosc?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.386#“With pleasure, madame,” and they both returned to the drawing-room.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.387#Mouret resumed his place on the sofa, when Baron Hartmann had sat
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.388#down; the young man then broke out in praise of the Credit Immobiliers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.389#operations. From that he went on to the subject so near his heart,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.390#speaking of the new thoroughfare, of the lengthening of the Rue Reaumur,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.391#of which they were going to open a section under the name of the Rue du
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.392#Dix-Décembre, between the Place de la Bourse and the Place de
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.393#l'Opera. It had been declared a work of public utility eighteen months
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.394#previously; the expropriation jury had just been appointed. The whole
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.395#neighbourhood was excited about this new opening, anxiously awaiting the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.396#commencement of the work, taking an interest in the condemned houses.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.397#Mouret had been waiting three years for this work--first, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.398#expectation of an increase of business; secondly, with certain schemes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.399#of enlargement which he dared not openly avow, so extensive were his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.400#ideas. As the Rue du Dix-Décembre was to cut through the Rue de Choiseul
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.401#and the Rue de la Michodière, he saw The Ladies' Paradise invading
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.402#the whole block, surrounded by these streets and the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.403#Neuve-Saint-Augustin; he already imagined it with a princely frontage in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.404#the new thoroughfare, lord and master of the conquered city. Hence his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.405#strong desire to make Baron Hartmann's acquaintance, when he learnt that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.406#the Crédit Immobilier had made a contract with the authorities to open
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.407#and build the Rue du Dix-Décembre, on condition that they received the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.408#frontage ground on each side of the street.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.409#“Really,” repeated he, trying to assume a naïve look, “you'll hand over
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.410#the street ready made, with sewers, pavements, and gas lamps. And the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.411#frontage ground will suffice to compensate you. Oh! it's curious, very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.412#curious!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.413#At last he came to the delicate point. He was aware that the Crédit
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.414#Immobilier was buying up the houses which surrounded The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.415#Paradise, not only those which were to fall under the demolisher's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.416#hands, but the others as well, those which were to remain standing; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.417#he suspected the projectment of some future establishment He was very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.418#anxious about the enlargements of which he continued to extend the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.419#dream, seized with fear at the idea of one day clashing with a powerful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.420#company, owning property which they certainly would not part with. It
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.421#was precisely this fear which had decided him to establish a connection
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.422#immediately between himself and the baron--the amiable connection of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.423#woman, so powerful between men of a gallant nature. No doubt he could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.424#have seen the financier in his office, and talked over the affair in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.425#question at his ease; but he felt himself stronger in Henriette's house;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.426#he knew how much the mutual possession of a mistress serves to render
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.427#men pliable and tender. To be both near her, within the beloved perfume
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.428#of her presence, to have her ready to convince them with a smile, seemed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.429#to him a certainty of success.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.430#“Haven't you bought the old Hôtel Duvillard, that old building next to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.431#mine?” he asked suddenly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.432#The baron hesitated a moment, and then denied it. But Mouret looked in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.433#his face and smiled, playing, from that moment, the part of a good young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.434#man, open-hearted, simple, and straightforward in business.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.435#“Look here, baron,” said he, “as I have the unexpected honour of meeting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.436#you, I must make a confession. Oh, I don't ask you any of your secrets,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.437#but I am going to entrust you with mine, certain that I couldn't place
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.438#them in wiser hands. Besides, I want your advice. I have long wished to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.439#call and see you, but dared not do so.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.440#He did make his confession, he related his start, not even concealing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.441#the financial crisis through which he was passing in the midst of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.442#triumph. Everything was brought up, the successive enlargements, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.443#profits continually put back into the business, the sums brought by his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.444#employees, the house risking its existence at every fresh sale, in which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.445#the entire capital was staked, as it were, on a single throw of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.446#dice. However, it was not money he wanted, for he had a fanatic's faith
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.447#in his customers; his ambition ran higher; he proposed to the baron a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.448#partnership, into which the Credit Immobilier should bring the colossal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.449#palace he saw in his dreams, whilst he, for his part, would give his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.450#genius and the business already created. The estate could be valued,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.451#nothing appeared to him easier to realise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.452#“What are you going to do with your land and buildings?” asked he,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.453#persistently. “You have a plan, no doubt. But I'm quite certain your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.454#idea is not so good as mine. Think of that. We build a gallery on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.455#ground, we pull down or re-arrange the houses, and we open the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.456#extensive establishment in Paris--a bazaar which will bring in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.457#millions.” And he let slip the fervent heartfelt exclamation: “Ah! if I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.458#could only do without you! But you get hold of everything now. Besides,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.459#I shall never have the necessary capital. Come, we must come to an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.460#understanding. It would be a crime not to do so.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.461#“How you go ahead, my dear sir!” Baron Hartmann contented himself with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.462#replying. “What an imagination!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.463#He shook his head, and continued to smile, determined not to return
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.464#confidence for confidence. The intention of the Crédit Immobilier was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.465#to create in the Rue du Dix-Décembre a rival to the Grand Hôtel, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.466#luxurious establishment, the central position of which would attract
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.467#foreigners. At the same time, as the hôtel was only to occupy a certain,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.468#frontage, the baron could also have entertained Mouret's idea, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.469#treated for the rest of the block of houses, occupying a vast surface.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.470#But he had already advanced funds to two of Henriette's friends, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.471#he was getting tired of his position as complacent protector. Besides,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.472#notwithstanding his passion for activity, which prompted him to open his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.473#purse to every fellow of intelligence and courage, Mouret's commercial
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.474#genius astonished more than captivated him. Was it not a fanciful,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.475#imprudent operation, this gigantic shop? Would he not risk a certain
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.476#failure in thus enlarging out of all bounds the drapery trade? In short,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.477#he didn't believe in it; he refused.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.478#“No doubt the idea is attractive, but it's a poet's idea. Where would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.479#you find the customers to fill such a cathedral?” Mouret looked at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.480#him for a moment silently, as if stupefied at his refusal. Was it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.481#possible?--a man of such foresight, who smelt money at no matter what
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.482#depth! And suddenly, with an extremely eloquent gesture, he pointed to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.483#the ladies in the drawing-room and exclaimed: “There are my customers!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.484# The sun was going down, the golden-red flame was now but a pale light,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.485#dying away in a farewell gleam on the silk of the hangings and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.486#panels of the furniture. At this approach of twilight, an intimacy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.487#bathed the large room in a sweet softness. While Monsieur de Boves and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.488#Paul de Vallagnosc were talking near one of the windows, their eyes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.489#wandering far away into the gardens, the ladies had closed up, forming
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.490#in the middle of the room a narrow circle of petticoats, from which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.491#issued sounds of laughter, whispered words, ardent questions and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.492#replies, all the passion felt by woman for expenditure and finery. They
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.493#were talking about dress, and Madame de Boves was describing a costume
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.494#she had seen at a ball.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.495#“First of all, a mauve silk skirt, then over that flounces of old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.496#Alençon lace, twelve inches deep.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.497#“Oh! is it possible!” exclaimed Madame Marty. “Some women are
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.498#fortunate!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.499#Baron Hartmann, who had followed Mouret's gesture, was looking at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.500#ladies through the door, which was wide open. He was listening to them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.501#with one ear, whilst the young man, inflamed by the desire to convince
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.502#him, went deeper into the question, explaining the mechanism of the new
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.503#style of drapery business. This branch of commerce was now based on a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.504#rapid and continual turning over of the capital, which it was necessary
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.505#to turn into goods as often as possible in the same year. Thus, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.506#year his capital, which only amounted to five hundred thousand francs,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.507#had been turned over four times, and had thus produced business to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.508#the amount of two millions. But this was a mere trifle, which could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.509#be increased tenfold, for later on he certainly hoped to turn over the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.510#capital fifteen or twenty times in certain departments.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.511#“You will understand, baron, that the whole system lies in this. It
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.512#is very simple, but it had to be found out. We don't want a very large
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.513#working capital; our sole effort is to get rid as quickly as possible of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.514#our stock to replace it by another, which will give our capital as many
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.515#times its interest. In this way we can content ourselves with a very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.516#small profit; as our general expenses amount to the enormous figure of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.517#sixteen per cent., and as we seldom make more than twenty per cent, on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.518#our goods, it is only a net profit of four per cent at most; but this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.519#will finish by bringing in millions when we can operate on considerable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.520#quantities of goods incessantly renewed. You follow me, don't you?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.521#nothing can be clearer.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.522#The baron shook his head again. He who had entertained the boldest
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.523#combinations, of whom people still quoted the daring flights at the time
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.524#of the introduction of gas, still remained uneasy and obstinate.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.525#“I quite understand,” said he; “you sell cheap to sell a quantity, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.526#you sell a quantity to sell cheap. But you must sell, and I repeat my
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.527#former question: Whom will you sell to? How do you hope to keep up such
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.528#a colossal sale?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.529#The sudden burst of a voice, coming from the drawing-room, cut short
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.530#Mouret's explanation. It was Madame Guibal, who was saying she would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.531#have preferred the flounces of old Alençon down the front only.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.532#“But, my dear,” said Madame de Boves, “the front was covered with it as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.533#well. I never saw anything richer.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.534#“Ah, that's a good idea,” resumed Madame Desforges, “I've got several
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.535#yards of Alençon somewhere; I must look them up for a trimming.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.536#And the voices fell again, becoming nothing but a murmur. Prices were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.537#quoted, quite a traffic stirred up their desires, the ladies were buying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.538#lace by the mile.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.539#“Why!” said Mouret, when he could speak, “we can sell what we like when
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.540#we know how to sell! There lies our triumph.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.541#And with his southern spirit, he showed the new business at work in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.542#warm, glowing phrases which evoked whole pictures. First came the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.543#wonderful power of the piling up of the goods, all accumulated at one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.544#point, sustaining and pushing each other, never any stand-still, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.545#article of the season always on hand; and from counter to counter the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.546#customer found herself seized, buying here the material, further on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.547#cotton, elsewhere the mantle, everything necessary to complete her dress
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.548#in fact, then falling into unforeseen purchases, yielding to her longing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.549#for the useless and the pretty. He then went on to sing the praises of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.550#the plain figure system. The great revolution in the business sprung
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.551#from this fortunate inspiration. If the old-fashioned small shops were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.552#dying out it was because they could not struggle against the low prices
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.553#guaranteed by the tickets. The competition was now going on under
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.554#the very eyes of the public; a look into the windows enabled them to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.555#contrast the prices; every shop was lowering its rates, contenting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.556#itself with the smallest possible profit; no cheating, no stroke of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.557#fortune prepared long beforehand on an article sold at double its value,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.558#but current operations, a regular percentage on all goods, success
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.559#depending solely on the orderly working of a sale all the larger from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.560#the fact of its being carried on in broad daylight. Was it not an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.561#astonishing creation? It was causing a revolution in the market,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.562#transforming Paris, for it was made of woman's flesh and blood.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.563#“I have the women, I don't care a hang for the rest!” said Mouret, in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.564#brutal confession which passion snatched from him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.565#At this cry Baron Hartmann appeared moved. His smile lost its touch of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.566#irony; he looked at the young man, won over gradually by his confidence,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.567#feeling a growing tenderness for him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.568#“Hush!” murmured he, paternally, “they will hear you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.569#But the ladies were now all speaking at once, so excited that they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.570#weren't even listening to each other. Madame de Boves was finishing the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.571#description of a dinner-dress; a mauve silk tunic, draped and caught up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.572#by bows of lace; the bodice cut very low, with more bows of lace on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.573#shoulders.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.574#“You'll see,” said she. “I am having a bodice made like it, with some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.575#satin----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.576#“I,” interrupted Madame Bourdelais, “I wanted some velvet. Oh! such a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.577#bargain!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.578#Madame Marty asked: “How much for the silk?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.579#And off they started again, all together. Madame Guibal, Henriette, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.580#Blanche were measuring, cutting out, and making up. It was a pillage of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.581#material, a ransacking of all the shops, an appetite for luxury which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.582#expended itself in toilettes longed for and dreamed of--such a happiness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.583#to find themselves in an atmosphere of finery, that they lived buried in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.584#it, as in the warm air necessary to their existence.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.585#Mouret, however, had glanced towards the other drawingroom, and in a few
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.586#phrases whispered into the baron's ear, as if he were confiding to him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.587#one of those amorous secrets that men sometimes risk among themselves,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.588#he finished explaining the mechanism of modern commerce. And, above the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.589#facts already given, right at the summit, appeared the exploitation of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.590#woman. Everything depended on that, the capital incessantly renewed, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.591#system of piling up goods, the cheapness which attracts, the marking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.592#in plain figures which tranquilises. It was for woman that all the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.593#establishments were struggling in wild competition; it was woman that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.594#they were continually catching in the snare of their bargains, after
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.595#bewildering her with their displays. They had awakened new desires in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.596#her flesh; they were an immense temptation, before which she succumbed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.597#fatally, yielding at first to reasonable purchases of useful articles
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.598#for the household, then tempted by their coquetry, then devoured. In
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.599#increasing their business tenfold, in popularising luxury, they became
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.600#a terrible spending agency, ravaging the households, working up the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.601#fashionable folly of the hour, always dearer. And if woman reigned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.602#in their shops like a queen, cajoled, flattered, overwhelmed with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.603#attentions, she was an amorous one, on whom her subjects traffic, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.604#who pays with a drop of her blood each fresh caprice. Through the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.605#very gracefulness of his gallantry, Mouret thus allowed to appear the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.606#brutality of a Jew, selling woman by the pound. He raised a temple to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.607#her, had her covered with incense by a legion of shopmen, created the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.608#rite of a new religion, thinking of nothing but her, continually seeking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.609#to imagine more powerful seductions; and, behind her back, when he had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.610#emptied her purse and shattered her nerves, he was full of the secret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.611#scorn of a man to whom a woman had just been stupid enough to yield
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.612#herself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.613#“Once have the women on your side,” whispered he to the baron, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.614#laughing boldly, “you could sell the very world.” Now the baron
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.615#understood. A few sentences had sufficed, he guessed the rest, and such
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.616#a gallant exploitation inflamed him, stirring up in him the memory of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.617#his past life of pleasure. His eyes twinkled in a knowing way, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.618#he ended by looking with an air of admiration at the inventor of this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.619#machine for devouring the women. It was really clever. He made the same
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.620#remark as Bourdoncle, suggested to him by his long experience: “You know
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.621#they'll make you suffer for it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.622#But Mouret shrugged his shoulders in a movement of overwhelming disdain.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.623#They all belonged to him, were his property, and he belonged to none
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.624#of them. After having drawn from them his fortune and his pleasure, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.625#intended to throw them all over for those who might still find their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.626#account in them. It was the rational, cold disdain of a Southerner and a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.627#speculator.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.628#“Well! my dear baron,” asked he in conclusion, “will you join me? Does
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.629#this affair appear possible to you?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.630#The baron, half conquered, did not wish, however, to engage himself yet
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.631#A doubt remained beneath the charm which was gradually operating on him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.632#He was going to reply in an evasive manner, when a pressing call from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.633#the ladies spared him the trouble. Voices were repeating, amidst silvery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.634#laughter: “Monsieur Mouret! Monsieur Mouret!” And as the latter, annoyed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.635#at being interrupted, pretended not to hear, Madame de Boves, who had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.636#just got up, came as far as the door of the little drawing-room.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.637#“You are wanted, Monsieur Mouret. It isn't very gallant of you to bury
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.638#yourself in a corner to talk over business.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.639#He then decided to go, with an apparent good grace, an air of rapture
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.640#which astonished the baron. Both rose up and passed into the other
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.641#drawing-room.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.642#“But I am quite at your service, ladies,” said he on entering, a smile
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.643#on his lips.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.644#He was greeted with a burst of triumph. He was obliged to go further
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.645#forward; the ladies made room for him in their midst The sun had just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.646#gone down behind the trees in the gardens, the day was departing, a fine
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.647#shadow was gradually invading the vast apartment. It was the tender hour
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.648#of twilight, that minute of discreet voluptuousness in the Parisian
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.649#houses, between the dying brightness of the street and the lighting of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.650#the lamps downstairs. Monsieur de Boves and Vallagnosc, still standing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.651#up before a window, threw a shadow on the carpet: whilst, motionless
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.652#in the last gleam of light which came in by the other window, Monsieur
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.653#Marty, who had quietly entered, and whom the conversation of these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.654#ladies about dress had completely confused, placed his poor profile, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.655#frock-coat, scanty but clean, his face pale and wan from teaching.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.656#“Is your sale still fixed for next Monday?” Madame Marty was just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.657#asking.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.658#“Certainly, madame,” replied Mouret, in a soft, sweet voice, an actor's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.659#voice, which he assumed when speaking to women.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.660#Henriette then intervened. “We are all going, you know. They say you are
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.661#preparing wonders.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.662#“Oh! wonders!” murmured he, with an air of modest fatuity. “I simply try
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.663#to deserve your patronage.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.664#But they pressed him with questions: Madame Bourdelais, Madame Guibal,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.665#Blanche even wanted to know.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.666#“Come, give us some details,” repeated Madame de Boves, persistently.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.667#“You are making us die of curiosity.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.668#And they were surrounding him, when Henriette observed that he had not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.669#even taken a cup of tea. It was distressing. Four of them set about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.670#serving him, but on condition that he would answer them afterwards.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.671#Henriette poured it out, Madame Marty held the cup, whilst Madame de
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.672#Boves and Madame Bourdelais contended for the honour of sweetening it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.673#Then, when he had declined to sit down, and commenced to drink his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.674#tea slowly, standing up in the midst of them, they all approached,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.675#imprisoning him in the narrow circle of their skirts; and with their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.676#heads raised, their eyes sparkling, they sat there smiling at him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.677#“Your silk, your Paris Paradise, that all the papers are taking about?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.678# resumed Madame Marty, impatiently.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.679#“Oh!” replied he, “an extraordinary article, coarse-grained, supple and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.680#strong. You'll see it, ladies, and you'll see it nowhere else, for we
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.681#have bought the exclusive right of it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.682#“Really! a fine silk at five francs twelve sous!” said Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.683#Bourdelais, enthusiastic. “One cannot credit it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.684#Ever since the advertisement had appeared, this silk had occupied a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.685#considerable place in their daily life. They talked of it, promising
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.686#themselves some of it, worked up with desire and doubt. And, beneath
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.687#the gossiping curiosity with which they overwhelmed the young man, there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.688#appeared their various temperaments as buyers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.689#Madame Marty, carried away by her rage for spending, took everything at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.690#The Ladies' Paradise, without choosing, just as the articles appeared;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.691#Madame Guibal walked about the shop for hours without ever buying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.692#anything, happy and satisfied to simply feast her eyes; Madame de Boves,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.693#short of money, always tortured by some immoderate wish, nourished a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.694#feeling of rancour against the goods she could not carry away; Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.695#Bourdelais, with the sharp eye of a careful practical housewife, made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.696#straight for the bargains, using the big establishments with such a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.697#clever housewife's skill that she saved a heap of money; and lastly,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.698#Henriette, who, very elegant, only procured certain articles there, such
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.699#as gloves, hosiery, and her coarser linen.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.700#“We have other stuffs of astonishing cheapness and richness,” continued
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.701#Mouret, with his musical voice. “For instance, I recommend you our
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.702#Golden Grain, a taffeta of incomparable brilliancy. In the fancy silks
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.703#there are some charming lines, designs chosen from among thousands by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.704#our buyer: and in velvets you will find an exceedingly rich collection
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.705#of shades. I warn you that cloth will be greatly worn this year; you'll
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.706#see our checks and our cheviots.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.707#They had ceased to interrupt him, and narrowed the circle, their mouths
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.708#half open with a vague smile, their eager faces close to his, as in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.709#sudden rush of their whole being towards the tempter. Their eyes grew
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.710#dim, a slight shudder ran through them. All this time he retained his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.711#calm, conquering air, amidst the intoxicating perfumes which their hair
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.712#exhaled; and between each sentence he continued to sip a little of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.713#tea, the aroma of which cooled those sharper odours, in which there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.714#was a particle of the savage. Before a captivating grace so thoroughly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.715#master of itself, strong enough to play with woman in this way without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.716#being overcome by the intoxication which she exhales, Baron Hartmann,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.717#who had not ceased to look at him, felt his admiration increasing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.718#“So cloth will be worn?” resumed Madame Marty, whose ravished face
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.719#sparkled with coquettish passion.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.720#Madame Bourdelais, who kept a cool look-out, said, in her turn: “Your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.721#sale of remnants takes place on Thursday, doesn't it? I shall wait. I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.722#have all my little ones to clothe.” And turning her delicate blonde head
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.723#towards the mistress of the house: “Sauveur is still your dressmaker, I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.724#suppose?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.725#“Yes,” replied Henriette, “Sauveur is very dear, but she is the only one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.726#in Paris who knows how to make a bodice. Besides, Monsieur Mouret may
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.727#say what he likes, she has the prettiest designs, designs that are not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.728#seen anywhere else. I can't bear to see my dresses on every woman's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.729#back.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.730#Mouret smiled discreetly at first. Then he intimated that Madame Sauveur
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.731#bought her material at his shop; no doubt she went to the manufacturers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.732#direct for certain designs of which she acquired the sole right of sale;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.733#but for all black silks, for instance, she watched for The Paradise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.734#bargains, laying in a considerable stock, which she disposed of at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.735#double and treble the price she gave.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.736#“Thus I am quite sure her buyers will snap up all our Paris Paradise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.737#Why should she go to the manufacturers and pay dearer for this silk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.738#than she would at my place? On my word of honour, we shall sell it at a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.739#loss.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.740#This was a decisive blow for the ladies. The idea of getting goods below
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.741#cost price awoke in them all the greed felt by women, whose enjoyment
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.742#as buyers is doubled when they think they are robbing the tradesman. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.743#knew them to be incapable of resisting anything cheap.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.744#“But we sell everything for nothing!” exclaimed he gaily, taking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.745#up Madame Desforges's fan, which was behind him on the table. “For
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.746#instance, here's this fan. I don't know what it cost.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.747#“The Chantilly lace was twenty-five francs, and the mounting cost two
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.748#hundred,” said Henriette.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.749#“Well, the Chantilly isn't dear. However, we have the same at eighteen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.750#francs; as for the mount, my dear madame, it's a shameful robbery. I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.751#should not dare to sell one like it for more than ninety francs.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.752#“Just what I said!” exclaimed Madame Bourdelais.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.753#“Ninety francs!” murmured Madame de Boves; “one must be very poor indeed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.754#to go without one at that price.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.755#She had taken up the fan, and was again examining it with her daughter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.756#Blanche; and, on her large regular face, in her big sleepy eyes, there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.757#arose an expression of the suppressed and despairing longing of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.758#caprice in which she could not indulge. The fan once more went the round
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.759#of the ladies, amidst various remarks and exclamations. Monsieur de
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.760#Boves and Vallagnosc, however, had left the window. Whilst the former
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.761#had returned to his place behind Madame Guibal, the charms of whose bust
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.762#he was admiring, with his correct and superior air, the young man was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.763#leaning over Blanche, endeavouring to find something agreeable to say.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.764#“Don't you think it rather gloomy, mademoiselle, this white mount and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.765#black lace?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.766#“Oh,” replied she, gravely, not a blush colouring her inflated cheeks,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.767#“I once saw one made of mother-of-pearl and white lace. Something truly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.768#virginal!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.769#Monsieur de Boves, who had doubtless observed the heartbroken, longing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.770#looks with which his wife was following the fan, at last added his word
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.771#to the conversation. “These flimsy things don't last long, they soon
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.772#break,” said he.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.773#“Of course they do!” declared Madame Guibal, with an air of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.774#indifference. “I'm tired of having mine mended.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.775#For several minutes, Madame Marty, excited by the conversation, was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.776#feverishly turning her red leather bag about on her lap, for she had not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.777#yet been able to show her purchases. She was burning to display them,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.778#with a sort of sensual desire; and, suddenly forgetting her husband's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.779#presence, she took out a few yards of narrow lace wound on a piece of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.780#cardboard.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.781#“It's the Valenciennes for my daughter,” said she. “It's an inch and a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.782#half wide. Isn't it delicious? One franc eighteen sous.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.783#The lace was passed from hand to hand. The ladies were astonished.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.784#Mouret assured them he sold these little trimmings at cost price.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.785#However, Madame Marty had closed the bag, as if to conceal certain
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.786#things she could not show. But after the success obtained by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.787#Valenciennes she was unable to resist the temptation of taking out a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.788#handkerchief.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.789#“There was this handkerchief as well. Real Brussels, my dear. Oh! a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.790#bargain! Twenty francs!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.791#And after that the bag became inexhaustible, she blushed with pleasure,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.792#a modesty like that of a woman undressing herself made her appear more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.793#charming and embarrassed at each fresh article she took out. There was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.794#a Spanish blonde-lace cravat, thirty francs: she didn't want it, but the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.795#shopman had sworn it was the last, and that in future the price would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.796#be raised. Next came a Chantilly veil: rather dear, fifty francs; if she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.797#didn't wear it she could make it do for her daughter.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.798#“Really, lace is so pretty!” repeated she with her nervous laugh. “Once
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.799#I'm inside I could buy everything.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.800#“And this?” asked Madame de Boves, taking up and examining a remnant of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.801#Maltese lace.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.802#“That,” replied she, “is for an insertion. There are twenty-six yards--a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.803#franc the yard. Just fancy!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.804#“But,” said Madame Bourdelais, surprised, “what are you going to do with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.805#it?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.806#“I'm sure I don't know. But it was such a funny pattern!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.807#At this moment she raised her eyes and perceived her terrified husband
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.808#in front of her. He had turned paler than usual, his whole person
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.809#expressed the patient, resigned anguish of a man assisting, powerless,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.810#at the reckless expenditure of his salary, so dearly earned. Every fresh
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.811#bit of lace was for him a disaster; bitter days of teaching swallowed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.812#up, long journeys to pupils through the mud devoured, the continued
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.813#effort of his life resulting in a secret misery, the hell of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.814#necessitous household. Before the increasing wildness of his look, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.815#wanted to catch up the veil, the cravat, and the handkerchief, moving
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.816#her feverish hands about, repeating with forced laughter: “You'll get
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.817#me a scolding from my husband. I assure you, my dear, I've been very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.818#reasonable; for there was a fine piece of point at five hundred francs,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.819#oh! a marvel!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.820#“Why didn't you buy it?” asked Madame Guibal, calmly. “Monsieur Marty is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.821#the most gallant of men.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.822#The poor professor was obliged to bow and say his wife was perfectly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.823#welcome. But the idea of this point at five hundred francs was like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.824#a lump of ice dripping down his back; and as Mouret was just at that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.825#moment affirming that the new shops increased the comfort of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.826#middle-class households, he glared at him with a terrible expression,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.827#the flash of hatred of a timid man who would have throttled him had he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.828#dared.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.829#But the ladies had still kept hold of the bits of lace, fascinated,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.830#intoxicated. The pieces were unrolled, passed from one to the other,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.831#drawing the admirers closer still, holding them in the delicate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.832#meshes. On their laps there was a continual caress of this tissue,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.833#so miraculously fine, and amidst which their culpable fingers fondly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.834#lingered. They still kept Mouret a close prisoner, overwhelming him with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.835#fresh questions. As the day continued to decline, he was now and again
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.836#obliged to bend his head, grazing their hair with his beard, to examine
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.837#a stitch, or indicate a design. But in this soft voluptuousness of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.838#twilight, in the midst of this warm feminine atmosphere, Mouret still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.839#remained their master beneath the rapture he affected. He seemed, to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.840#a woman himself, they felt themselves penetrated and overcome by this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.841#delicate sense of their secret that he possessed, and they abandoned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.842#themselves, captivated; whilst he, certain from that moment to have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.843#them at his mercy, appeared, brutally triumphing over them, the despotic
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.844#monarch of dress.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.845#“Oh, Monsieur Mouret!” stammered they, in low, hysterical voices, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.846#gloom of the drawing-room.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.847#The last rays of the setting sun were dying away on the brass-work
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.848#of the furniture. The laces alone retained a snowy reflex on the dark
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.849#dresses of the ladies, of which the confused group seemed to surround
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.850#the young man with a vague appearance of kneeling, worshipping women. A
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.851#light still shone on the side of the silver teapot, a short flame like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.852#that of a night-light, burning in an alcove warmed by the perfume of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.853#tea. But suddenly the servant entered with two lamps, and the charm was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.854#destroyed. The drawing-room became light and cheerful. Madame Marty was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.855#putting her lace in her little bag, Madame de Boves was eating a sponge
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.856#cake, whilst Henriette who had got up, was talking in a half-whisper to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.857#the baron, near one of the windows.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.858#“He's a charming fellow,” said the baron.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.859#“Isn't he?” exclaimed she, with the involuntary cry of a woman in love.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.860#He smiled, and looked at her with a paternal indulgence. This was the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.861#first time he had seen her so completely conquered; and, too proud to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.862#suffer from it, he experienced nothing but a feeling of compassion on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.863#seeing her in the hands of this handsome fellow, so tender and yet so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.864#cold-hearted. He thought he ought to warn her, and murmured in a joking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.865#tone: “Take care, my dear, or he'll eat you all up.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.866#A flash of jealousy lighted up Henriette's eyes. Perhaps she understood
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.867#Mouret had simply made use of her to get at the baron; and she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.868#determined to render him mad with passion, he whose hurried style of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.869#making love had the easy charm of a song thrown to the four winds of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.870#heaven. “Oh,” said she, affecting to joke in her turn, “the lamb always
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.871#finishes up by eating the wolf.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.872#The baron, greatly amused, encouraged, her with a nod. Could she be the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.873#woman who was to avenge all the others?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.874#When Mouret, after having reminded Vallagnosc that he wanted to show him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.875#his machine at work, came up to take his leave, the baron retained him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.876#near the window opposite the gardens, now buried in darkness. He yielded
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.877#at last to the seduction; his confidence had come on seeing him in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.878#midst of these ladies. Both conversed for a moment in a low tone, then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.879#the banker said: “Well, I'll look into the affair. It's settled if your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.880#Monday's sale proves as important as you expect.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.881#They shook hands, and Mouret, delighted, took his leave, for he did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.882#enjoy his dinner unless he went and gave a look at the day's receipts at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iii.883#The Ladies' Paradise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1#CHAPTER IV.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.2#The following Monday, the 10th of October, a clear, victorious sun
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.3#pierced the grey clouds which had darkened Paris during the previous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.4#week. It had drizzled all the previous night, a sort of watery mist, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.5#humidity of which dirtied the streets; but in the early morning, thanks
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.6#to the sharp wind which was driving the clouds away, the pavement had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.7#become drier, and the blue sky had a limpid, spring-like gaiety.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.8#Thus The Ladies' Paradise, after eight o'clock, blazed forth beneath
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.9#the clear rays of the sun, in all the glory of its great sale of winter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.10#novelties. Flags were flying at the door, and pieces of woollens were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.11#flapping about in the fresh morning air, animating the Place Gaillon
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.12#with the bustle of a country fair; whilst in both streets the windows
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.13#developed symphonies of displays, the clearness of the glass showing up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.14#still further the brilliant tones. It was like a debauch of colour,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.15#a street pleasure which burst forth there, a wealth of goods publicly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.16#displayed, where everybody could go and feast their eyes.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.17#But at this hour very few people entered, only a few rare customers,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.18#housewives of the neighbourhood, women desirous of avoiding the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.19#afternoon crush. Behind the stuffs which decorated it, one could feel
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.20#the shop to be empty, under arms and waiting for customers, with its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.21#waxed floors and counters overflowing with goods.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.22#The busy morning crowd barely glanced at the windows, without lingering
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.23#a moment. In the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin and in the Place Gaillon,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.24#where the carriages were to take their stand, there were only two cabs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.25#at nine o'clock. The inhabitants of the district, especially the small
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.26#traders, stirred up by such a show of streamers and decorations, formed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.27#little groups in the doorways, at the corners of the streets, gazing at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.28#the shop, making bitter remarks. What most filled them with indignation
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.29#was the sight of one of the four delivery vans just introduced by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.30#Mouret, which was standing in the Rue de la Michodière, in front of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.31#delivery office. They were green, picked out with yellow and red, their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.32#brilliantly varnished panels sparkling in the sun with the brightness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.33#of purple and gold. This van, with its brand-new medley of colours,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.34#the name of the house painted on each side, and surmounted with an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.35#advertisement of the day's sale, finished by going off at a trot, drawn
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.36#by a splendid horse, after being filled up with the previous night's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.37#parcels; and Baudu, who was standing on the threshold of The Old Elbeuf,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.38#watched it as far as the boulevard, where it disappeared, to spread all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.39#over Paris in a starry radiance the hated name of The Ladies' Paradise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.40#However, a few cabs were arriving and forming a line.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.41#Every time a customer entered, there was a movement amongst the shop
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.42#messengers, who were drawn up under the lofty doorway, dressed in livery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.43#consisting of a light green coat and trousers, and striped red and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.44#yellow waistcoat. Jouve, the inspector and retired captain, was also
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.45#there, in a frock-coat and white tie, wearing his decoration like a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.46#sign of respectability and probity, receiving the ladies with a gravely
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.47#polite air, bending over them to point out the departments. Then they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.48#disappeared in the vestibule, which was transformed into an oriental
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.49#saloon.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.50#From the very threshold it was a marvel, a surprise, which enchanted all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.51#of them. It was Mouret who had been struck with this idea. He was the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.52#first to buy, in the Levant, at very advantageous rates, a collection of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.53#old and new carpets, articles which up to the present had only been sold
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.54#at curiosity shops, at high prices; and he intended to flood the market
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.55#with these goods, selling them at a little over cost price, simply
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.56#drawing from them a splendid decoration destined to attract the best
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.57#class of art customers to his establishment From the centre of the Place
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.58#Gaillon could be seen this oriental saloon, composed solely of carpets
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.59#and door curtains which had been hung under his orders. The ceiling was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.60#covered with a quantity of Smyrna carpets, the complicated designs of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.61#which stood out boldly on a red ground. Then from each side there hung
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.62#Syrian and Karamanian door-curtains, speckled with green, yellow, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.63#vermilion; Diarbekir door-curtains of a commoner type, rough to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.64#touch, like shepherds' cloaks; besides these there were carpets which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.65#could be used as door-curtains and hangings--long Ispahan, Teheran,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.66#and Kermancha rugs, the larger Schoumaka and Madras carpets, a strange
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.67#florescence of peonies and palms, the fancy let loose in a garden of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.68#dreams. On the floor were more carpets, a heap of greasy fleeces: in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.69#centre was an Agra carpet, an extraordinary article with a white ground
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.70#and a broad delicate blue border, through which ran violet-coloured
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.71#ornaments of exquisite design. Everywhere there was an immense display
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.72#of marvellous fabrics; Mecca carpets with a velvety reflection, prayer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.73#carpets from Daghestan with a symbolic point, Kurdistan carpets covered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.74#with blossoming flowers; and finally, piled up in a corner, a heap of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.75#Gherdes, Koula, and Kirchur rugs from fifteen francs a piece.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.76#This sumptuous pacha's tent was furnished with divans and arm-chairs,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.77#made with camel sacks, some ornamented with many-coloured lozenges,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.78#others with primitive roses. Turkey, Arabia, and the Indies were all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.79#there. They had emptied the palaces, plundered the mosques and bazaars.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.80#A barbarous gold tone prevailed in the weft of the old carpets,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.81#the faded tints of which still preserved a sombre warmth, as of an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.82#extinguished furnace, a beautiful burnt hue suggestive of the old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.83#masters. Visions of the East floated beneath the luxury of this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.84#barbarous art, amid the strong odour which the old wools had retained of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.85#the country of vermin and of the rising sun.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.86#In the morning at eight o'clock, when Denise, who was to commence on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.87#that very Monday, had crossed the oriental saloon, she stood there,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.88#lost in astonishment, unable to recognise the shop entrance, entirely
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.89#overcome by this harem-like decoration planted at the door. A messenger
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.90#having shown her to the top of the house, and handed her over to Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.91#Cabin, who cleaned and looked after the rooms, this person installed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.92#her in No. 7, where her box had already been put. It was a narrow
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.93#cell, opening on the roof by a skylight, furnished with a small bed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.94#a walnut-wood wardrobe, a toilet-table, and two chairs. Twenty similar
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.95#rooms ran along the convent-like corridor, painted yellow; and, out of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.96#the thirty-five young ladies in the house, the twenty who had no friends
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.97#in Paris slept there, whilst the remaining fifteen lodged outside, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.98#few with borrowed aunts and cousins. Denise at once took off her shabby
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.99#woollen dress, worn thin by brushing and mended at the sleeves, the only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.100#one she had brought from Valognes; she then put on the uniform of her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.101#department, a black silk dress which had been altered for her and which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.102#she found ready on the bed. This dress was still too large, too wide
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.103#across the shoulders; but she was so hurried in her emotion that she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.104#paid no heed to these details of coquetry. She had never worn silk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.105#before. When she went downstairs again, dressed up, uncomfortable, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.106#looked at the shining skirt, feeling ashamed of the noisy rustling of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.107#the silk.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.108#Down below, as she was entering her department, a quarrel burst out. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.109#heard Clara say, in a shrill voice:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.110#“Madame, I came in before her.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.111#“It isn't true,” replied Marguerite. “She pushed past me at the door,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.112#but I had already one foot in the room.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.113#It was for the inscription on the list of turns, which regulated the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.114#sales. The saleswomen wrote their names on a slate in the order of their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.115#arrival, and whenever one of them had served a customer, she re-wrote
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.116#her name beneath the others. Madame Aurélie finished by deciding in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.117#Marguerite's favour.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.118#“Always some injustice here!” muttered Clara, furiously. But Denise's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.119#entry reconciled these young ladies. They looked at her, then smiled to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.120#each other. How could a person truss herself up in that way! The young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.121#girl went and awkwardly wrote her name on the list, where she found
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.122#herself last. Meanwhile, Madame Aurélie was examining her with an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.123#anxious face. She could not help saying:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.124#“My dear, two like you could get into your dress; you must have it taken
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.125#in. Besides, you don't know how to dress yourself. Come here and let me
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.126#arrange you a bit.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.127#And she placed herself before one of the tall glasses alternating with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.128#the doors of the cupboards containing the dresses. The vast apartment,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.129#surrounded by these glasses and the wood-work in carved oak, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.130#floor covered with red Wilton carpet of a large pattern, resembled the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.131#commonplace drawing-room of an hotel, traversed by a continual stream of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.132#travellers. The young ladies completed the resemblance, dressed in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.133#regulation silk, promenading their commercial charms about, without ever
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.134#sitting down on the dozen chairs reserved for the customers. All wore
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.135#between two buttonholes of the body of their dresses, as if stuck in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.136#their bosoms, a long pencil, with its point in the air; and half out of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.137#their pockets, could be seen the white cover of the book of debit-notes.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.138#Several risked wearing jewellery--rings, brooches, chains; but their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.139#great coquetry, the luxury they all struggled for in the forced
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.140#uniformity of their dress, was their bare hair, quantities of it,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.141#augmented by plaits and chignons when their own did not suffice, combed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.142#curled, and decked out in every way.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.143#“Pull the waist down in front,” said Madame Aurélie. “There, you have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.144#now no hump on your back. And your hair, how can you massacre it like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.145#that? It would be superb, if you only took a little trouble.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.146#This was, in fact, Denise's only beauty. Of a beautiful flaxen hue, it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.147#fell down to her ankles; and when she did it up, it was so troublesome
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.148#that she simply rolled it in a knot, keeping it together under the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.149#strong teeth of a bone comb. Clara, greatly annoyed by this head of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.150#hair, affected to laugh at it, so strange did it look, twisted up anyhow
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.151#in its savage grace. She made a sign to a saleswoman in the under-linen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.152#department, a girl with a large face and agreeable manner. The two
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.153#departments, which were close together, were in continual hostility; but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.154#the young ladies sometimes joined together in laughing at other people.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.155#“Mademoiselle Cugnot, just look at that mane,” said Clara, whom
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.156#Marguerite was nudging, feigning also to be on the point of bursting out
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.157#laughing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.158#But Mademoiselle Cugnot was not in the humour for joking. She had been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.159#looking at Denise for a moment, and she remembered what she had suffered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.160#herself during the first few months of her arrival in the establishment.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.161#“Well, what?” said she. “Everybody hasn't got a mane like that!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.162#And she returned to her place, leaving the two others very crestfallen.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.163#Denise, who had heard all, followed her with a look of thanks, while
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.164#Madame Aurélie gave our heroine a book of debit-notes with her name on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.165#it, saying: “To-morrow you'll get yourself up better; and, now, try and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.166#pick up the ways of the house, wait your turn for selling. To-day's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.167#work will be very hard; we shall be able to judge of your capabilities.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.168# However, the department still remained deserted; very few customers came
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.169#up at this early hour. The young ladies reserved themselves, prudently
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.170#preparing for the fatigues of the afternoon. Denise, intimidated by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.171#thought that they were watching her, sharpened her pencil, for the sake
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.172#of something to do; then, imitating the others, she stuck it into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.173#her bosom, between two buttonholes, and summoned up all her courage,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.174#determined to conquer a position. The previous evening they had told her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.175#she entered as a probationer, that is to say without any fixed salary;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.176#she would simply have the commission and a certain allowance on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.177#everything she sold. But she fully hoped to earn twelve hundred francs a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.178#year in this way, knowing that the good saleswomen earned as much as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.179#two thousand, when they liked to take the trouble. Her expenses were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.180#regulated; a hundred francs a month would enable her to pay Pépé's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.181#board and lodging, assist Jean, who did not earn a sou, and procure some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.182#clothes and linen for herself. But, in order to attain this large sum,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.183#she would have to show herself industrious and pushing, taking no notice
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.184#of the ill-will displayed by those around her, fighting for her share,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.185#even snatching it from her comrades if necessary. As she was thus
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.186#working herself up for the struggle, a tall young man, passing the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.187#department, smiled at her; and when she saw it was Deloche, who had been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.188#engaged in the lace department the previous day, she returned his smile,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.189#happy at the friendship which thus presented itself, accepting this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.190#smile as a good omen.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.191#At half-past nine a bell rang for the first luncheon. Then a fresh peal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.192#announced the second; and still no customers appeared. The second-hand,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.193#Madame Frédéric, who, in her disagreeable widow's harshness, delighted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.194#in prophesying disasters, declared in short sentences that the day
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.195#was lost, that they would not see a soul, that they might close the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.196#cupboards and go away; predictions which darkened Marguerite's flat
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.197#face, she being a girl who looked sharp after her profits, whilst Clara,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.198#with her runaway-horse appearance, was already dreaming of an excursion
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.199#to the Verrières woods, if the house failed. As for Madame Aurélie, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.200#was there, silent and serious, promenading her Cæsar-like mask about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.201#the empty department, like a general who has a certain responsibility
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.202#in victory and in defeat. About eleven o'clock a few ladies appeared.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.203#Denise's turn for serving had arrived. Just at that moment a customer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.204#came up.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.205#“The fat old girl from the country,” murmured Marguerite.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.206#It was a woman of forty-five, who occasionally journeyed to Paris from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.207#the depths of some out-of-the-way place. There she saved up for months;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.208#then, hardly out of the train, she made straight for The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.209#Paradise, and spent all her savings. She very rarely ordered anything
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.210#by letter, she liked to see and handle the goods, and laid in a stock of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.211#everything, even down to needles, which she said were excessively dear
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.212#in her small town. The whole staff knew her, that her name was Boutarel,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.213#and that she lived at Albi, but troubled no further about her, neither
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.214#about her position nor her mode of life.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.215#“How do you do, madame?” graciously asked Madame Aurélie, who had come
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.216#forward. “And what can we show you? You shall be attended to at once.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.217# Then, turning round: “Now, young ladies!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.218#Denise approached; but Clara had sprung forward. As a rule, she was very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.219#careless and idle, not caring about the money she earned in the shop, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.220#she could get plenty outside, without trouble. But the idea of doing the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.221#new-comer out of a good customer spurred her on.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.222#“I beg your pardon, it's my turn,” said Denise, indignantly. Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.223#Aurélie set her aside with a severe look, saying: “There are no turns.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.224#I alone am mistress here. Wait till you know, before serving our regular
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.225#customers.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.226#The young girl retired, and as the tears were coming in her eyes, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.227#she wished to conceal this excess of sensibility, she turned her back,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.228#standing up before the window, pretending to be looking into the street.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.229#Were they going to prevent her selling? Would they all arrange together
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.230#to deprive her of the important sales, like that? A fear for the future
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.231#seized her, she felt herself crushed between so many interests let
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.232#loose. Yielding to the bitterness of her abandonment, her forehead
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.233#against the cold glass, she gazed at The Old Elbeuf opposite, thinking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.234#she ought to have implored her uncle to keep her. Perhaps he himself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.235#regretted his decision, for he seemed to her greatly affected the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.236#previous evening. Now she was quite alone in this vast house, where no
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.237#one liked her, where she found herself hurt, lost. Pépé and Jean, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.238#had never left her side, were living with strangers; it was a cruel
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.239#separation, and the big tears which she kept back made the street dance
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.240#in a sort of fog. All this time, the hum of voices continued behind her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.241#“This one makes me look a fright,” Madame Boutarel was saying.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.242#“You really make a mistake, madame,” said Clara; “the shoulders fit
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.243#perfectly--but perhaps you would prefer a pelisse to a mantle?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.244#But Denise started. A hand was laid on her arm. Madame Aurélie addressed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.245#her severely:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.246#“Well, you're doing nothing now--eh? only looking at the people passing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.247#Things can't go on this way, you know!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.248#“But they prevent me selling, madame.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.249#“Oh, there's other work for you, mademoiselle! Begin at the beginning.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.250#Do the folding-up.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.251#In order to please the few customers who had called, they had been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.252#obliged to ransack all the cupboards, and on the two long oaken tables,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.253#to the right and the left, were heaps of mantles, pelisses, and capes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.254#garments of all sizes and all materials. Without replying, Denise set
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.255#about sorting them, folding them carefully and arranging them again
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.256#in the cupboards. This was the lowest work, generally performed by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.257#beginners. She ceased to protest, knowing that they required the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.258#strictest obedience, waiting till the first hand should be good enough
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.259#to let her sell, as she seemed at first to have the intention of doing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.260#She was still folding, when Mouret appeared on the scene. This was a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.261#violent shock for her; she blushed without knowing why, she felt herself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.262#invaded by a strange fear, thinking he was going to speak to her. But he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.263#did not even see her; he no longer remembered this little girl whom the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.264#charming impression of an instant had induced him to support.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.265#“Madame Aurélie,” called he in a brief voice.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.266#He was rather pale, but his eyes were clear and resolute. In making the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.267#tour of the departments he had found them empty, and the possibility
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.268#of a defeat had suddenly presented itself in the midst of his obstinate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.269#faith in fortune. True, it was only eleven o'clock; he knew by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.270#experience that the crowd never arrived much before the afternoon. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.271#certain symptoms troubled him. At the previous sales, a general movement
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.272#had taken place from the morning even; besides he did not see any of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.273#those bareheaded women, customers living in the neighbourhood, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.274#usually dropped into his shop as into a neighbour's. Like all great
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.275#captains, he felt at the moment of giving battle a superstitious
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.276#weakness, notwithstanding his habitually resolute attitude. Things would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.277#not go on well, he was lost, and he could not have explained why; he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.278#thought he could read his defeat on the faces of the passing ladies
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.279#even.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.280#Just at that moment, Madame Boutarel, she who always bought something,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.281#was going away, saying: “No, you have nothing that pleases me. I'll see,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.282#I'll decide later on.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.283#Mouret watched her depart. Then, as Madame Aurélie ran up at his call,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.284#he took her aside, and they exchanged a few rapid words. She wore a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.285#despairing air, and was evidently admitting that things were looking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.286#bad. For a moment they remained face to face, seized with one of those
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.287#doubts which generals conceal from their soldiers. Ultimately he said
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.288#out loud in his brave way: “If you want assistance, understand, take a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.289#girl from the workroom. She'll be a little help to you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.290#He continued his inspection in despair. He had avoided Bourdoncle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.291#all the morning, for his anxious doubts irritated him. On leaving the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.292#under-linen department, where business was still worse, he dropped right
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.293#on to him, and was obliged to submit to the expression of his fears. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.294#did not hesitate to send him to the devil, with a brutality that even
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.295#his principal employees came in for when things were looking bad.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.296#“Get out of my way!” said he. “Everything is going on all right. I shall
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.297#end by pitching out the tremblers.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.298#Mouret planted himself alone on the landing of the hall-staircase. From
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.299#there he commanded the whole shop; around him the departments on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.300#first-floor; beneath, those of the ground-floor. Above, the emptiness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.301#seemed heart-breaking; in the lace department, an old woman was having
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.302#everything turned over and buying nothing; whilst three good-for-nothing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.303#minxes in the under-linen department were slowly choosing some collars
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.304#at eighteen sous. Down below, under the covered galleries, in the ray of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.305#light which came in from the street, he noticed that the customers were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.306#commencing to get more numerous. It was a slow, broken procession,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.307#a promenade before the counters; in the mercery and the haberdashery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.308#departments some women of the commoner class were pushing about, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.309#there was hardly a customer in the linen or in the woollen departments.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.310#The shop messengers, in their green coats, the buttons of which shone
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.311#brilliantly, were waiting for customers, their hands dangling about. Now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.312#and again there passed an inspector with a ceremonious air, very stiff
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.313#in his white neck-tie. Mouret was especially grieved by the mortal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.314#silence which reigned in the hall, where the light fell from above from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.315#a ground glass window, showing a white dust, diffuse and suspended, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.316#it were, under which the silk department seemed to be sleeping, amid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.317#a shivering religious silence. A shopman's footstep, a few whispered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.318#words, the rustling of a passing skirt, were the only noises heard,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.319#and they were almost stifled by the hot air of the heating apparatus.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.320#However, carriages began to arrive, the sudden piffling up of the horses
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.321#was heard, and immediately after the banging of the carriage doors.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.322#Outside, a distant tumult was commencing to make itself heard, groups of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.323#idlers were pushing in front of the windows, cabs were taking up their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.324#positions in the Place Gaillon, there were all the appearances of an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.325#approaching crowd. But on seeing the idle cashiers leaning back on their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.326#chairs behind their wickets, and observing that the parcel-tables
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.327#with their boxes of string and reams of blue packing-paper remained
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.328#unoccupied, Mouret, though indignant with himself for being afraid,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.329#thought he felt his immense machine stop and turn cold beneath him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.330#“I say, Favier,” murmured Hutin, “look at the governor up there. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.331#doesn't seem to be enjoying himself.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.332#“This is a rotten shop!” replied Favier. “Just fancy, I've not sold a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.333#thing yet.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.334#Both of them, waiting for customers, whispered such short remarks from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.335#time to time without looking at each other. The other salesmen of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.336#department were occupied in arranging large bales of the Paris Paradise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.337#under Robineau's orders; whilst Bouthemont, in full consultation with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.338#thin young woman, seemed to be taking an important order. Around them,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.339#on frail and elegant shelves, the silks, folded in long pieces of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.340#creamy paper, were heaped up like pamphlets of an unusual size; and,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.341#encumbering the counters, were fancy silks, moires, satins, velvets,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.342#presenting the appearance of mown flowers, quite a harvest of delicate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.343#precious tissues. This was the most elegant of all the departments, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.344#veritable drawingroom, where the goods, so light and airy, were nothing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.345#but a luxurious furnishing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.346#“I must have a hundred francs by Sunday,” said Hutin. “If I don't make
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.347#an average of twelve francs a day, I'm lost. I'd reckoned on this sale.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.348#“By Jovel a hundred francs; that's rather stiff,” said Favier. “I only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.349#want fifty or sixty. You must go in for swell women, then?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.350#“Oh, no, my dear fellow. It's a stupid affair; I made a bet and lost. So
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.351#I have to stand a dinner for five persons, two fellows and three girls.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.352#Hang me! the first one that passes I'll let her in for twenty yards of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.353#Paris Paradise!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.354#They continued talking for several minutes, relating what they had done
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.355#the previous day, and what they intended to do the next week. Favier
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.356#did a little betting, Hutin did a little boating, and kept music-hall
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.357#singers. But they were both possessed by the same desire for money,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.358#struggling for it all the week, and spending it all on Sunday. It was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.359#their sole preoccupation in the shop, an hourly and pitiless struggle.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.360#And that cunning Bouthemont had just managed to get hold of Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.361#Sauveur's messenger, the skinny woman with whom he was talking! good
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.362#business, three or four dozen pieces, at least, for the celebrated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.363#dressmaker always gave good orders. At that moment Robineau took it into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.364#his head to do Favier out of a customer.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.365#“Oh! as for that fellow, we must settle up with him,” said Hutin, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.366#took advantage of the slightest thing in order to stir up the salesmen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.367#against the man whose place he coveted.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.368#“Ought the first and second hands to sell? My word of honour! my dear
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.369#fellow, if ever I become second you'll see how well I shall act with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.370#others.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.371#And all his little Norman person, so fat and jolly, played the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.372#good-natured man energetically. Favier could not help casting a side
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.373#glance towards him, but he preserved his phlegmatical air, contenting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.374#himself with replying: “Yes, I know. I should be only too pleased.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.375# Then, as a lady came up, he added in a lower tone: “Look out! Here's one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.376#for you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.377#It was a lady with a blotchy face, a yellow bonnet, and a red dress.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.378#Hutin immediately recognised in her a woman who would buy nothing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.379#He quickly stooped behind the counter, pretending to be doing up his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.380#boot-lace; and, thus concealed, he murmured: “No fear, let some one else
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.381#take her. I don't want to lose my turn!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.382#However, Robineau called out: “Whose turn, gentlemen? Monsieur Hutin's?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.383#Where's Monsieur Hutin?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.384#And as this gentleman still gave no reply, it was the next salesman who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.385#served the lady with the blotches. Hutin was right, she simply wanted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.386#some samples with the prices; and she kept the salesman more than ten
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.387#minutes, overwhelming him with questions. However, Robineau had seen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.388#Hutin get up from behind the counter; so that when another customer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.389#arrived, he interfered with a stern air, stopping the young man, who was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.390#rushing forward.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.391#“Your turn is passed. I called you, and as you were there behind----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.392#“But I didn't hear you, sir.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.393#“That'll do! Write your name at the bottom. Now, Monsieur Favier, it's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.394#your turn.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.395#Favier, greatly amused at heart at this adventure, threw a glance at his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.396#friend, as if to excuse himself. Hutin, with pale lips, had turned his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.397#head away. What enraged him was that he knew the customer very well,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.398#an adorable blonde who often came to their department, and whom the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.399#salesmen called amongst themselves “the pretty lady,” knowing nothing of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.400#her, not even her name. She bought a great deal, had her purchases taken
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.401#to her carriage, and immediately disappeared. Tall, elegant, dressed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.402#with exquisite taste, she appeared to be very rich, and to belong to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.403#best society.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.404#“Well! and your courtesan?” asked Hutin of Favier, when the latter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.405#returned from the pay-desk, where he had accompanied the lady.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.406#“Oh! a courtesan!” replied the other. “I fancy she looks too lady-like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.407#for that. She must be the wife of a stockbroker or a doctor, or
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.408#something of that sort.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.409#“Don't tell me! it's a courtesan. With their grand lady airs it's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.410#impossible to tell now-a-days!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.411#Favier looked at his book of debit-notes. “I don't care!” said he, “I've
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.412#stuck her for two hundred and ninety-three francs. That makes nearly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.413#three francs for me.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.414#Hutin bit his lips, and vented his spleen on the debit notebooks.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.415#Another invention for cramming their pockets. There was a secret rivalry
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.416#between these two. Favier, as a rule, pretended to sing small, to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.417#recognise Hutin's superiority, but in reality devouring him all the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.418#while behind his back. Thus Hutin was wild at the thought of the three
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.419#francs pocketed so easily by a salesman whom he considered to be his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.420#inferior in business. A fine day's work! If it went on like this, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.421#would not earn enough to pay for the seltzer water for his guests. And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.422#in the midst of the battle, which was now becoming fiercer, he walked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.423#along the counters with hungry eyes, eager for his share, jealous even
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.424#of his superior, who was just showing the thin young woman out, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.425#saying to her:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.426#“Very well! it's understood. Tell her I'll do my best to obtain this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.427#favour from Monsieur Mouret.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.428#Mouret had quitted his post on the stairs some time before. Suddenly he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.429#reappeared on the landing of the principal staircase which communicated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.430#with the ground floor; and from there he commanded a view of the whole
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.431#establishment. His face had regained its colour, his faith was restored
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.432#and increasing before the crowd which was gradually filling the place.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.433#It was the expected rush at last, the afternoon crush, which he had for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.434#a moment despaired of. All the shopmen were at their posts, a last ring
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.435#of the bell had announced the end of the third lunch; the disastrous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.436#morning, due no doubt to a shower which fell about nine o'clock, could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.437#still be repaired, for the blue sky of early morn had resumed its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.438#victorious gaiety. Now that the first-floor departments were becoming
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.439#animated, he was obliged to stand back to make way for the women who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.440#were going up to the under-clothing and dress departments; whilst,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.441#behind him, in the lace and the shawl departments, he heard large
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.442#sums bandied about. But the sight of the galleries on the ground-floor
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.443#especially reassured him. There was a crowd at the haberdashery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.444#department, and even the linen and woollen departments were invaded. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.445#procession of buyers closed up, nearly all of a higher class at present,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.446#with a few lingering housewives. Under the pale light of the silk hall,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.447#ladies had taken off their gloves to feel the Paris Paradise, talking in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.448#half-whispers. And there was no longer any mistaking the noises arriving
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.449#from outside, rolling of cabs, banging of carriage-doors, an increasing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.450#tumult in the crowd. He felt the machine commencing to work under him,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.451#getting up steam and reviving, from the pay-desks where the money was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.452#jingling, and the tables where the messengers were hurriedly packing up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.453#the goods, down to the basement, in the delivery-room, which was quickly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.454#filling up with the parcels sent down, and the underground rumbling of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.455#which seemed to shake the whole house. In the midst of the crowd was the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.456#inspector, Jouve, walking about gravely, watching for thieves.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.457#“Hullo! is that you?” said Mouret, all at once, recognising Paul de
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.458#Vallagnosc whom a messenger had conducted to him. “No, no, you are
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.459#not in my way. Besides, you've only to follow me if you want to see
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.460#everything, for to-day I stay at the breach.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.461#He still felt anxious. No doubt there were plenty of people, but would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.462#the sale prove to be the triumph he hoped for? However, he laughed with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.463#Paul, carrying him off gaily.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.464#“It seems to be picking up a bit,” said Hutin to Favier. “But somehow
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.465#I've no luck; there are some days that are precious bad, my word! I've
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.466#just made another miss, that old frump hasn't bought anything.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.467#And he glanced towards a lady who was walking off, casting looks of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.468#disgust at all the goods. He was not likely to get fat on his thousand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.469#francs a year, unless he sold something; as a rule he made seven or
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.470#eight francs a day commission, which gave him with his regular pay an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.471#average of ten francs a day. Favier never made much more than eight, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.472#there was this animal taking the bread out of his mouth, for he had just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.473#sold another dress--a cold-natured fellow who had never known how to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.474#amuse a customer! It was exasperating.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.475#“Those chaps over there seem to be doing very well,” remarked Favier,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.476#speaking of the salesmen in the hosiery and haberdashery departments.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.477#But Hutin, who was looking all round the place, suddenly asked: “Do you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.478#know Madame Desforges, the governor's sweetheart? Look! that dark woman
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.479#in the glove department, who is having some gloves tried on by Mignot.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.480# He stopped, then resumed in a low tone, as if speaking to Mignot, on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.481#whom he continued to keep his eyes: “Oh, go on, old man, you may pull
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.482#her fingers about as much as you like, that won't do you any good! We
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.483#know your conquests!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.484#There was a rivalry between himself and the glove-man, the rivalry
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.485#of two handsome fellows, who both affected to flirt with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.486#lady-customers. As a matter of fact they had neither had any real
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.487#conquests to boast about. Mignot lived on the legend of a police
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.488#superintendent's wife who had fallen in love with him, whilst Hutin had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.489#really conquered a lace-maker who had got tired of wandering about in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.490#the doubtful hotels in the neighbourhood; but they invented a lot
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.491#of mysterious adventures, leading people to believe in all sorts of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.492#appointments made by titled ladies, between two purchases.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.493#“You should get hold of her,” said Favier, in his sly, artful way.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.494#“That's a good idea!” exclaimed Hutin. “If she comes here I'll let her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.495#in for something extensive; I want a five-franc piece!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.496#In the glove department quite a row of ladies were seated before the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.497#narrow counter covered with green velvet and edged with nickel silver;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.498#and the smiling shopmen were heaping up before them the flat boxes of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.499#bright red, taken out of the counter itself, and resembling the ticketed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.500#drawers of a secrétaire. Mignot especially was bending his pretty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.501#doll-like face over his customer, his thick Parisian voice full of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.502#tender inflections. He had already sold Madame Desforges a dozen pairs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.503#of kid gloves, the Paradise gloves, one of the specialities of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.504#house. She then took three pairs of Swedish, and was now trying on some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.505#Saxon gloves, for fear the size should not be exact.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.506#“Oh! quite perfect, madame!” repeated Mignot. “Six and a quarter would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.507#be too large for a hand like yours.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.508#Half lying on the counter, he was holding her hand, taking the fingers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.509#one by one, slipping the glove on with a long, renewed, and persistently
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.510#caressing air, looking at her as if he expected to see in her face
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.511#the signs of a voluptuous joy. But she, with her elbow on the velvet
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.512#counter, her wrist raised, gave him her fingers with the unconcerned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.513#air with which she gave her foot to her maid to allow her to button her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.514#boot. For her he was not a man; she employed him for such private work
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.515#with the familiar disdain she showed for the people in her service,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.516#without looking at him even.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.517#“I don't hurt you, madame?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.518#She replied “No,” with a shake of the head. The smell of the Saxon
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.519#gloves--that savage smell as of sugared musk--troubled her as a rule;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.520#and she sometimes laughed about it, confessing her taste for this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.521#equivocal perfume, in which there is a suspicion of the wild beast
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.522#fallen into some girl's powder-box. But seated at this commonplace
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.523#counter she did not notice the smell of the gloves, it raised no sensual
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.524#feeling between her and this salesman doing his work.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.525#“And what next, madame?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.526#“Nothing, thanks. Be good enough to carry the parcel to the pay-desk No.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.527#10, for Madame Desforges.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.528#Being a constant customer, she gave her name at a pay-desk, and had each
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.529#purchase sent there without wanting a shopman to follow her. When she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.530#had gone away, Mignot turned towards his neighbour and winked, and would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.531#have liked him to believe that wonderful things had just taken place.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.532#“By Jove! I'd like to dress her all over!” said he, coarsely. Meanwhile,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.533#Madame Desforges continued her purchases. She turned to the left,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.534#stopping in the linen department to procure some dusters; then she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.535#walked round the shop, going as far as the woollen department at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.536#further end of the gallery. As she was satisfied with her cook,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.537#she wanted to make her a present of a dress. The woollen department
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.538#overflowed with a compact crowd, all the lower middle-class women were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.539#there, feeling the stuff, absorbed in mute calculations; and she was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.540#obliged to sit down for a moment. The shelves were piled up with great
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.541#rolls of stuff which the salesmen were taking down one by one, with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.542#sudden pull. They were beginning to get confused with these encumbered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.543#counters, on which the stuffs were mixing up and tumbling over each
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.544#other. It was a rising tide of neutral tints, heavy woollen tones,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.545#iron-greys, and blue-greys, with here and there a Scotch tartan, and a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.546#blood-red ground of flannel breaking out. And the white tickets on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.547#the pieces were like a shower of rare white flakes falling on a black
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.548#December soil.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.549#Behind a pile of poplin, Liénard was joking with a tall girl without hat
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.550#or bonnet, a work-girl, sent by her mistress to match some merino.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.551#He detested these big-sale days, which tired him to death, and he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.552#endeavoured to shirk his work, getting plenty of money from his father,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.553#not caring a fig about the business, doing just enough to avoid being
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.554#dismissed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.555#“Listen to me, Mademoiselle Fanny,” he was saying; “you are always in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.556#a hurry. Did the striped vicugna do the other day? I shall come and see
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.557#you, and ask for my commission.” But the girl escaped, laughing, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.558#Liénard found himself before Madame Desforges, whom he could not help
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.559#asking: “What can I serve you with, madame?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.560#She wanted a dress, not too dear but yet strong. Liénard, with the view
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.561#of sparing his arms, which was his principal care, manoeuvred to make
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.562#her take one of the stuffs already unfolded on the counter. There were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.563#cashmeres, serges, vicugnas, and he declared that there was nothing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.564#better to be had, they never wore out. But none of these seemed to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.565#satisfy her. On one of the shelves she had observed a blue serge, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.566#she wished to see. He made up his mind at last, and took down the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.567#roll, but she thought it too rough. Then he showed her a cheviot, some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.568#diagonal, some greys, every sort of woollens, which she felt out of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.569#curiosity, for the pleasure of doing so, decided at heart to take
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.570#no matter what. The young man was thus obliged to empty the highest
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.571#shelves; his shoulders cracked, the counter had disappeared under the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.572#silky grain of the cashmeres and poplins, the rough nap of the cheviot,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.573#and the tufty down of the vicugna; there were samples of every material
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.574#and every tint. Though she had not the least wish to buy any, she asked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.575#to see some grenadine and some Chambéry gauze. Then, when she had seen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.576#enough, she said:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.577#“Oh! after all, the first is the best; it's for my cook. Yes, the serge,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.578#the one at two francs.” And when Liénard had measured it, pale with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.579#suppressed anger, she added: “Have the goodness to carry that to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.580#pay-desk No. 10, for Madame Desforges.” Just as she was going away,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.581#she recognised Madame Marty close to her, accompanied by her daughter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.582#Valentine, a tall girl of fourteen, thin and bold, who was already
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.583#casting a woman's covetous looks on the goods.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.584#“Ah! it's you, dear madame?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.585#“Yes, dear madame; what a crowd--eh?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.586#“Oh! don't speak of it, it's stifling. And such a success! Have you seen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.587#the oriental saloon?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.588#“Superb--wonderful!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.589#And amidst the pushing and crushing of the growing crowd of modest
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.590#purses eagerly seeking the cheap lines in the woollen goods, they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.591#went into ecstasies over the exhibition of carpets. Then Madame Marty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.592#explained she was looking for some material for a mantle; but she was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.593#not quite decided; she wanted to see some check patterns.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.594#“Look, mamma,” murmured Valentine, “it's too common.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.595#“Come to the silk department,” said Madame Desforges, “you must see
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.596#their famous Paris Paradise.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.597#Madame Marty hesitated for a moment. It would be very dear, and she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.598#faithfully promised her husband to be careful! She had been buying for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.599#an hour, quite a pile of articles were following her already: a muff and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.600#some cuffs and collars for herself, some stockings for her daughter. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.601#finished by saying to the shopman who was showing her the checks:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.602#“Well--no; I'm going to the silk department; you've nothing to suit me.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.603#The shopman took the articles and walked before the ladies. In the silk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.604#department there was also a crowd, the principal crush being opposite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.605#the inside display, arranged by Hutin, and to which Mouret had given the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.606#finishing touches. It was at the further end of the hall, around one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.607#of the small wrought-iron columns which supported the glass roof, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.608#veritable torrent of stuffs, a puffy sheet falling from, above and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.609#spreading out? down to the floor. At first stood out the light satins
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.610#and tender silks, the satins _à la Reine_ and Renaissance, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.611#the pearly tones of spring water; light silks, transparent as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.612#crystals--Nile-green, Indian-azure, May-rose, and Danube-blue. Then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.613#came the stronger fabrics: marvellous satins, duchess silks, warm tints,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.614#rolling in great waves; and right at the bottom, as in a fountain-basin,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.615#reposed the heavy stuffs, the figured silks, the damasks, brocades,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.616#and lovely silvered silks in the midst of a deep bed of velvet of every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.617#sort--black, white, and coloured--skilfully disposed on silk and satin
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.618#grounds, hollowing out with their medley of colours a still lake in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.619#which the reflex of the sky seemed to be dancing. The women, pale with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.620#desire, bent over as if to look at themselves. And before this falling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.621#cataract they all remained standing, with the secret fear of being
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.622#carried away by the irruption of such luxury, and with the irresistible
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.623#desire to jump in amidst it and be lost.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.624#“Here you are, then!” said Madame Desforges, on finding Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.625#Bourdelais installed before a counter.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.626#“Ah! good-morning!” replied the latter, shaking hands with the ladies.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.627#“Yes, I've come to have a look.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.628#“What a prodigious exhibition! It's like a dream. And the oriental
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.629#saloon! Have you seen the oriental saloon?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.630#“Yes, yes; extraordinary!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.631#But beneath this enthusiasm, which was to be decidedly the fashionable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.632#note of the day, Madame Bourdelais retained her practical housekeeper's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.633#coolness. She was carefully examining a piece of Paris Paradise, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.634#she had come on purpose to take advantage of the exceptional cheapness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.635#of this silk, if she found it really advantageous. She was doubtless
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.636#satisfied with it, for she took twenty-five yards, hoping it would be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.637#sufficient to make a dress for herself and a cloak for her little girl.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.638#“What! you are going already?” resumed Madame Desforges. “Take a walk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.639#round with us.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.640#“No, thanks; they are waiting for me at home. I didn't like to risk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.641#bringing the children into this crowd.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.642#And she went away, preceded by the salesman carrying * the twenty-five
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.643#yards of silk, and who led her to pay-desk No. 10, where young Albert
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.644#was getting confused with all the demands for bills with which he was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.645#besieged. When the salesman was able to approach, after having inscribed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.646#his sale on the debit-note, he called out the item, which the cashier
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.647#entered in a register; then it was checked over, and the leaf torn
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.648#off the salesman's book of debit-notes was stuck on a file near the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.649#receipting stamp.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.650#“One hundred and forty francs,” said Albert.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.651#Madame Bourdelais paid and gave her address, for having come on foot she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.652#did not wish to be troubled with a parcel. Joseph had already got the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.653#silk behind the pay-desk, and was tying it up; and the parcel, thrown
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.654#into a basket on wheels, was sent down to the delivery department, where
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.655#all the goods in the shop seemed to be swallowed up with a sluice-like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.656#noise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.657#Meanwhile, the block was becoming so great in the silk department that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.658#Madame Desforges and Madame Marty could not at first find a salesman
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.659#disengaged. They remained standing, mingling with the crowd of ladies
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.660#who were looking at the silks and feeling them, staying there hours
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.661#without making up their minds. But the Paris Paradise was a great
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.662#success; around it pressed one of those crowds which decides the fortune
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.663#of a fashion in a day. A host of shopmen were engaged in measuring off
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.664#this silk; one could see, above the customers' heads, the pale glimmer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.665#of the unfolded pieces, in the continual coming and going of the fingers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.666#along the oak yard measures hanging from brass rods; one could hear the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.667#noise of the scissors cutting the silk, without ceasing, as the sale
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.668#went on, as if there were not enough shopmen to suffice for all the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.669#greedy outstretched hands of the customers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.670#“It really isn't bad for five francs twelve sous,” said Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.671#Desforges, who had succeeded in getting hold of a piece at the edge of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.672#the table.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.673#Madame Marty and her daughter experienced a disappointment. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.674#newspapers had said so much about it, that they had expected something
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.675#stronger and more brilliant. But Bouthemont had just recognised Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.676#Desforges, and in order to get in the good graces of such a handsome
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.677#lady, who was supposed to be all-powerful with the governor, he came up,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.678#with his rather coarse amiability. What! no one was serving her! it was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.679#unpardonable! He begged her to be indulgent, for really they did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.680#know which way to turn. And he went to look for some chairs amongst the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.681#neighbouring skirts, laughing with his good-natured laugh, full of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.682#brutal love for the sex, which did not seem to displease Henrietta.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.683#“I say,” murmured Favier, on going to take some velvet from a shelf
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.684#behind Hutin, “there's Bouthemont making up to your mash.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.685#Hutin had forgotten Madame Desforges, beside himself with rage with an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.686#old lady, who, after having kept him a quarter of an hour, had finished
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.687#by buying a yard of black satin for a pair of stays. In the busy moments
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.688#they took no notice of the turns, each salesman served the customers as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.689#they arrived. And he was answering Madame Boutarel, who was finishing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.690#her afternoon at The Ladies' Paradise, where she had already spent three
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.691#hours in the morning, when Favier's warning made him start. Was he going
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.692#to miss the governor's friend, from whom he had sworn to draw a five
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.693#franc piece? That would be the height of ill-luck, for he hadn't made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.694#three francs as yet with all those other chignons who were mooning about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.695#the place! Bouthemont was just then calling out loudly:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.696#“Come, gentlemen, some one this way!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.697#Hutin passed Madame Boutarel over to Robineau, who was doing nothing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.698#“Here's the second-hand, madame. He will answer you better than I can.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.699#And he rushed off to take Madame Marty's purchases from the woollen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.700#salesman who had accompanied the ladies. That day a nervous excitement
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.701#must have troubled his delicate scent. As a rule, the first glance told
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.702#him if a customer would buy, and how much. Then he domineered over the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.703#customer, he hastened to serve her to pass on to another, imposing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.704#his choice on her, persuading her that he knew best what material she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.705#wanted.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.706#“What sort of silk, madame?” asked he in his most gallant manner. Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.707#Desforges had no sooner opened her mouth than he added: “I know, I've
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.708#got just what you want.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.709#When the piece of Paris Paradise was unfolded on a narrow corner of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.710#counter, between heaps of other silks, Madame Marty and her daughter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.711#approached. Hutin, rather anxious, understood that it was at first a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.712#question of serving these two. Whispered words were exchanged, Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.713#Desforges was advising her friend.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.714#“Oh! certainly,” murmured she. “A silk at five francs twelve sous will
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.715#never be equal to one at fifteen, or even ten.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.716#“It is very light,” repeated Madame Marty. “I'm afraid that it has not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.717#sufficient body for a mantle.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.718#This remarked induced the salesman to intervene. He smiled with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.719#exaggerated politeness of a man who cannot make a mistake.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.720#“But, madame, flexibility is the chief quality of this silk. It will not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.721#crumple. It's exactly what you want.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.722#Impressed by such an assurance, the ladies said no more. They had taken
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.723#the silk up, and were examining it again, when they felt a touch on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.724#their shoulders. It was Madame Guibal, who had been slowly walking about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.725#the shop for an hour past, feasting her eyes on the heaped-up riches,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.726#without buying even a yard of calico. And there was another explosion of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.727#gossip.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.728#“What! Is that you?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.729#“Yes, it's me, rather knocked about though.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.730#“What a crowd--eh? One can't get about. And the oriental saloon?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.731#“Ravishing!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.732#“Good heavens! what a success! Stay a moment, we will go upstairs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.733#together.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.734#“No, thanks, I've just come down.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.735#Hutin was waiting, concealing his impatience with a smile that did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.736#quit his lips. Were they going to keep him there long? Really the women
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.737#took things very coolly, it was like taking his money out of his pocket.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.738#At last Madame Guibal went away and continued her stroll, turning round
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.739#the splendid display of silks with an enraptured air.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.740#“If I were you I should buy the mantle ready-made,” said Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.741#Desforges, suddenly returning to the Paris Paradise. “It won't cost you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.742#so much.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.743#“It's true that the trimmings and making-up----” murmured Madame Marty.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.744#“Besides, one has more choice.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.745#All three had risen. Madame Desforges turned to Hutin, saying: “Have the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.746#goodness to show us to the ready-made department.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.747#He remained dumbfoundered, not being used to such defeats. What! the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.748#dark lady bought nothing! Had he then made a mistake? He abandoned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.749#Madame Marty and attacked Madame Desforges, trying his powerful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.750#abilities as salesman on her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.751#“And you, madame, would you not like to see our satins, our velvets? We
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.752#have some extraordinary bargains.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.753#“Thanks, another time,” replied she coolly, not looking at him any more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.754#than she had at Mignot.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.755#Hutin had to take up Madame Marty's purchases and walk before the ladies
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.756#to show them to the ready-made department But he had also the grief
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.757#of seeing that Robineau was selling Madame Boutarel a good quantity of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.758#silk. Decidedly his scent was playing him false, he wouldn't make four
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.759#sous. Beneath the amiable correctness of his manners there was the rage
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.760#of a man being robbed and swallowed up by the others.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.761#“On the first floor, ladies,” said he, without ceasing to smile.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.762#It was no easy matter to get to the staircase. A compact crowd of heads
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.763#was surging under the galleries, expanding like an overflowing river
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.764#into the middle of the hall. Quite a battle of business was going on,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.765#the salesmen had this population of women at their mercy, passing them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.766#from one to the other with feverish haste. The moment of the formidable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.767#afternoon rush had arrived, when the over-heated machine led the dance
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.768#of customers, drawing the money from their very flesh. In the silk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.769#department especially a breath of folly seemed to pervade all, the Paris
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.770#Paradise collected such a crowd that for several minutes Hutin could not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.771#advance a step; and Henriette, half-suffocated, having raised her eyes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.772#beheld Mouret at the top of the stairs, his favourite position, from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.773#which he could see the victory. She smiled, hoping that he would come
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.774#down and extricate her. But he did not even recognise her in the crowd;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.775#he was still with Vallagnosc, showing him the house, his face beaming
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.776#with triumph.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.777#The trepidation within was now stifling all outside noise; one no
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.778#longer heard the rumbling of the vehicles, nor the banging of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.779#carriage-doors; nothing remained above the vast murmur of business but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.780#the sentiment of this enormous Paris, of such immensity that it would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.781#always furnish buyers. In the heavy still air, in which the fumes of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.782#heating apparatus warmed the odour of the stuffs, the hubbub increased,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.783#made up of all sorts of noises, of the continual walking about, of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.784#same phrases, a hundred times repeated around the counters, of the gold
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.785#jingling on the brass of the pay-desks, besieged by a legion of purses,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.786#and of the baskets on wheels loaded with parcels which were constantly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.787#disappearing into the gaping cellars. And, amidst the fine dust,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.788#everything finished by getting mixed up, it became impossible to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.789#recognise the divisions of the different departments; the haberdashery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.790#department over there seemed drowned; further on, in the linen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.791#department, a ray of sunshine, entering by the window in the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.792#Neuve-Saint-Augustin, was like a golden dart in a heap of snow; close
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.793#by, in the glove and woollen departments, a dense mass of bonnets and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.794#chignons hid the background of the shop from view. The toilettes were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.795#no longer visible, the head-dresses alone appeared, decked with feathers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.796#and ribbons.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.797#A few men's hats introduced here and there a black spot, whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.798#the women's pale complexions assumed in the fatigue and heat the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.799#transparencies of the camellia. At last, Hutin--thanks to his vigorous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.800#elbows--was able to open a way for the ladies, by keeping in front of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.801#them. But on ascending the stairs, Henriette could not find Mouret,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.802#who had just plunged Vallagnosc right into the crowd to complete his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.803#bewilderment, himself feeling the physical want of a dip into this bath
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.804#of success. He lost his breath deliciously, he felt against his limbs a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.805#sort of caress from all his customers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.806#“To the left, ladies,” said Hutin, still attentive, notwithstanding his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.807#increasing exasperation.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.808#Up above there was the same block. It invaded even the furnishing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.809#department, usually the quietest. The shawl, the fur, and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.810#under-clothing departments swarmed with people. As the ladies were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.811#crossing the lace department another meeting took place. Madame de Boves
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.812#was there with her daughter Blanche, both buried in the articles Deloche
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.813#was showing them. And Hutin had to make another halt, bundle in hand.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.814#“Good afternoon! I was just thinking of you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.815#“I've been looking for you myself. But how can you expect to find any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.816#one in this crowd?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.817#“It's magnificent, isn't it?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.818#“Dazzling, my dear. We can hardly stand.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.819#“And you're buying?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.820#“Oh! no, we're only looking round. It rests us a little to be seated.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.821#As a fact, Madame de Boves, scarcely possessing more than her cab-fare
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.822#in her purse, was having all sorts of laces handed down, simply for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.823#pleasure of seeing and handling them. She had guessed Deloche to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.824#a new salesman, slow and awkward, who dared not resist the customers'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.825#whims; and she took advantage of his bewildered good-nature, and kept
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.826#him there half an hour, still asking for fresh articles. The counter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.827#was covered, she dived her hands into this increasing mountain of lace,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.828#Malines, Valenciennes, and Chantilly, her fingers trembling with desire,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.829#her face gradually warming with a sensual joy; whilst Blanche, close to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.830#her, agitated by the same passion, was very pale, her flesh inflated and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.831#soft. The conversation continued; Hutin, standing there waiting their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.832#good pleasure, could have slapped their faces.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.833#“Ah!” said Madame Marty, “you're looking at some cravats and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.834#handkerchiefs like those I showed you the other day.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.835#It was true, Madame de Boves, tormented by Madame Marty's lace since
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.836#the previous Saturday, had been unable to resist the desire to at least
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.837#handle some like it, as the allowance her husband made her did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.838#permit her to carry any away. She blushed slightly, explaining that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.839#Blanche wanted to see the Spanish-blonde cravats. Then she added:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.840#“You're going to the ready-made department--Well! we'll see you again.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.841#Shall we say in the oriental saloon?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.842#“That's it, in the oriental saloon--Superb, isn't it?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.843#And they separated enraptured, amidst the obstruction produced by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.844#sale of the insertions and small trimmings at low prices. Deloche, glad
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.845#to be occupied, recommenced emptying the boxes before the mother and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.846#daughter. And amidst the groups pressed along the counters, Jouve, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.847#inspector, was slowly walking about with his military air, displaying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.848#his decoration, watching over these fine and precious goods, so easy to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.849#conceal up a sleeve. When he passed behind Madame de Boves, surprised
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.850#to see her with her arms plunged in such a heap of lace he cast a quick
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.851#glance at her feverish hands.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.852#“To the right, ladies,” said Hutin, resuming his march.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.853#He was beside himself with rage. Was it not enough that he had missed a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.854#sale down below? Now they kept him waiting at each turning of the shop!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.855#And in his annoyance there was a strong feeling of the rancour existing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.856#between the textile departments and the ready-made departments, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.857#were in continual hostility, fighting over the customers, stealing each
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.858#other's percentage and commission. Those of the silk department were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.859#more enraged than those of the woollen, whenever they were obliged to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.860#show a lady to where the ready-made articles were kept, when she decided
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.861#to take a mantle after looking at various sorts of silk.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.862#“Mademoiselle Vadon!” said Hutin, in an angry voice, when he at last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.863#arrived in the department.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.864#But she passed by without listening, absorbed in a sale which she was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.865#conducting. The room was full, a stream of people were crossing it,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.866#coming in by the door of the lace department and going out by the door
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.867#of the under-clothing department, whilst to the right customers were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.868#trying on garments, and posing before the glasses. The red carpet
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.869#stifled the noise of the footsteps, the distant roar from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.870#ground-floor died away, giving place to a discreet murmur, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.871#drawing-room warmth deadened by the crowd of women.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.872#“Mademoiselle Prunaire!” cried out Hutin. And as she took no notice
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.873#either, he added between his teeth, so as not to be heard: “A set of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.874#frights!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.875#He certainly was not fond of them, tired to death as he was by climbing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.876#the stairs to bring them customers, furious at the profits which he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.877#accused them of taking out of his pocket It was a secret war, in which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.878#the young ladies themselves entered with equal fierceness; and in their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.879#mutual fatigue, always on foot, worked to death, all difference of sex
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.880#disappeared, nothing remained but these contrary interests, irritated by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.881#the fever of business.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.882#“So there's no one here to serve?” asked Hutin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.883#But he suddenly caught sight of Denise. They had kept her folding all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.884#the morning, only giving her a few doubtful customers to whom she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.885#not sold anything. When he recognised her, occupied in clearing off the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.886#counter an enormous heap of garments, he ran up to her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.887#“Look here, mademoiselle! serve these ladies who are waiting.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.888#And he quickly slipped Madame Marty's purchases into her arms, tired
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.889#of carrying them about the place. His smile returned, and in this smile
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.890#there was the ill-natured expression of the experienced salesman, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.891#shrewdly guessed into what an awkward position he had just thrown both
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.892#the ladies and the young girl. The latter, however, remained quite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.893#troubled before this unhoped-for sale which suddenly presented itself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.894#For the second time Hutin appeared to her like an unknown friend,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.895#fraternal and tender, always ready to spring out of darkness and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.896#save her. Her eyes glistened with gratitude; she followed him with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.897#lingering look, whilst he was elbowing his way towards his department.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.898#“I want a mantle,” said Madame Marty.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.899#Then Denise questioned her. What style of mantle? But the lady had no
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.900#idea, she wished to see what the house had got. And the young girl,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.901#already very tired, bewildered by the crowd, lost her head; she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.902#never served any but the rare customers who came to Cornaille's, at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.903#Valognes; she didn't even know the number of the models, nor their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.904#places in the cupboards. She hardly knew how to reply to the ladies, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.905#were beginning to lose patience, when Madame Aurélie perceived Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.906#Desforges, of whose connection with Mouret she was no doubt aware, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.907#she hastened over and asked with a smile:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.908#“Are these ladies being served?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.909#“Yes, that young person over there is attending to us,” replied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.910#Henriette. “But she does not appear to be very well up to her work; she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.911#can't find anything.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.912#At this, the first-hand completely paralysed Denise by saying to her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.913#in a whisper: “You see very well you know nothing. Don't interfere any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.914#more, please.” And turning round she called out: “Mademoiselle Vadon,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.915#these ladies require a mantle!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.916#She remained there whilst Marguerite showed the models. The girl assumed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.917#with the customers a dry polite voice, the disagreeable attitude of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.918#young person dressed up in silk, with a sort of varnish of elegance, of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.919#which she retained, unknown to herself, the jealousy and rancour.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.920#When she heard Madame Marty say she did not wish to exceed two hundred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.921#francs, she made a grimace of pity. Oh! madame would give more, it would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.922#be impossible to find anything respectable for two hundred francs. And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.923#she threw some of the common mantles on a counter with a gesture which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.924#signified: “Just see, aren't they pitiful?” Madame Marty dared not think
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.925#of them after that; she bent over to murmur in Madame Desforges's ear:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.926#“Don't you prefer to be served by men? One feels more comfortable?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.927#At last Marguerite brought a silk mantle trimmed with jet, which she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.928#treated with more respect And Madame Aurélie abruptly called Denise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.929#“Come, do something for your living. Just put that on your shoulders.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.930#Denise, wounded to the heart, despairing of ever succeeding in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.931#house, had remained motionless, her hands hanging by her side. No doubt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.932#she would be sent away, and the children would be without food. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.933#tumult of the crowd buzzed in her head, she felt herself tottering, her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.934#arms bruised by the handling of so many armfuls of garments, hard work
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.935#which she had never done before. However, she was obliged to obey and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.936#allow Marguerite to put the mantle on her, as on a dummy.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.937#“Stand upright,” said Madame Aurélie.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.938#But a moment after they forgot Denise. Mouret had just come in with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.939#Vallagnosc and Bourdoncle; and he bowed to the ladies, who complimented
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.940#him on his magnificent exhibition of winter novelties. Of course
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.941#they went into raptures over the oriental saloon. Vallagnosc, who was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.942#finishing his walk round the counters, displayed more surprise than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.943#admiration; for, after all, thought he, in his pessimist supineness,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.944#it was nothing more than an immense collection of calico. Bourdoncle,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.945#forgetting that he belonged to the establishment, also congratulated the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.946#governor, to make him forget his anxious doubts and persecutions of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.947#early part of the day.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.948#“Yes, yes; things are going on very well, I'm quite satisfied,” repeated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.949#Mouret, radiant, replying with a smile to Madame Desforges's tender
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.950#looks. “But I must not interrupt you, ladies.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.951#Then all eyes were again fixed on Denise. She placed herself entirely in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.952#the hands of Marguerite, who was making her turn round slowly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.953#“What do you think of it--eh?” asked Madame Marty of Madame Desforges.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.954#The latter gave her advice, like a supreme umpire of fashion. “It isn't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.955#bad, the cut is original, but it doesn't seem to me very graceful about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.956#the figure.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.957#“Oh!” interrupted Madame Aurélie, “it must be seen on the lady herself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.958#You can understand it does not look much on this young person, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.959#is not very stout. Hold up your head, mademoiselle, give it all its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.960#importance.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.961#They smiled. Denise had turned very pale. She felt ashamed at being thus
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.962#turned into a machine, which they were examining and joking about so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.963#freely.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.964#Madame Desforges, yielding to the antipathy of a contrary nature, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.965#annoyed by the young girl's sweet face, maliciously added: “No doubt it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.966#would set better if the young person's dress were not so loose-fitting.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.967#And she cast at Mouret the mocking look of a Parisian beauty, greatly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.968#amused by the absurd ridiculous dress of a country girl. He felt the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.969#amorous caress of this glance, the triumph of a woman proud of her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.970#beauty and of her art. Therefore, out of pure gratitude, the gratitude
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.971#of a man who felt himself adored, he thought himself obliged to joke
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.972#in his turn, notwithstanding his good-will towards Denise, whose secret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.973#charm had conquered his gallant nature.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.974#“Besides, her hair should be combed,” murmured he.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.975#This was the last straw. The director deigned to laugh, all the young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.976#ladies were bursting. Marguerite risked a slight chuckle, like a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.977#well-behaved girl who restrains herself; Clara had left a customer to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.978#enjoy the fun at her ease; even the saleswomen from another department
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.979#had come, attracted by the talking. As for the ladies they took it more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.980#quietly, with an air of well-bred enjoyment. Madame Aurélie was the only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.981#one who did not laugh, as if Denise's splendid wild-looking head of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.982#hair and elegant virginal shoulders had dishonoured her, in the orderly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.983#well-kept department. The young girl had turned paler still, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.984#midst of all these people who were laughing at her. She felt herself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.985#violated, exposed to all their looks, without defence. What had she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.986#done that they should thus attack her thin figure, and her too luxuriant
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.987#hair? But she was especially wounded by Madame Desforges's and Mouret's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.988#laughter, instinctively divining their connection, her heart sinking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.989#with an unknown grief. This lady was very ill-natured to attack a poor
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.990#girl who had said nothing; and as for Mouret, he most decidedly froze
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.991#her up with a sort of fear, before which all her other sentiments
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.992#disappeared, without her being able to analyse them. And, totally
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.993#abandoned, attacked in her most cherished womanly feelings of modesty,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.994#and shocked at their injustice, she was obliged to stifle the sobs which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.995#were rising in her throat.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.996#“I should think so; let her comb her hair to-morrow,” said the terrible
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.997#Bourdoncle to Madame Aurélie. He had condemned Denise the first day she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.998#came, full of scorn for her small limbs.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.999#At last the first-hand came and took the mantle off Denise's shoulders,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1000#saying to her in a low tone: “Well! mademoiselle, here's a fine start.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1001#Really, if this is the way you show off your capabilities----Impossible
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1002#to be more stupid!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1003#Denise, fearing the tears might gush from her, hastened back to the heap
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1004#of garments, which she began to sort out on the counter. There at least
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1005#she was lost in the crowd. Fatigue prevented her thinking. But she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1006#suddenly felt Pauline near her, a saleswoman in the under-clothing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1007#department, who had already defended her that morning. The latter had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1008#followed the scene, and murmured in Denise's ear:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1009#“My poor child, don't be so sensitive. Keep that to yourself, or they'll
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1010#go on worse and worse. I come from Chartres. Yes, exactly, Pauline
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1011#Cugnot is my name; and my parents are millers. Well! they would have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1012#devoured me the first few days if I had not stood up firm. Come, be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1013#brave! give me your hand, we'll have a talk together whenever you like.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1014#This hand held out redoubled Denise's confusion; she shook it furtively,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1015#hastening to take up a load of cloaks, fearing to be doing wrong and to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1016#get a scolding if they knew she had a friend.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1017#However, Madame Aurélie herself, had just put the mantle on Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1018#Marty, and they all exclaimed: “Oh! how nice! delightful!” It at once
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1019#looked quite different. Madame Desforges decided it would be impossible
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1020#to improve on it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1021#There was a good deal of bowing. Mouret took his leave, whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1022#Vallognosc, who had perceived Madame de Boves and her daughter in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1023#lace department, hastened to offer his arm to the mother. Marguerite,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1024#standing before one of the pay-desks, was already calling out the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1025#different purchases made by Madame Marty, who settled for them and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1026#ordered the parcel to be taken to her cab. Madame Desforges had found
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1027#her articles at pay-desk No. 10. Then the ladies met once more in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1028#oriental saloon. They were leaving, but it was amidst a loquacious
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1029#feeling of admiration. Even Madame Guibal became enthusiastic.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1030#“Oh! delicious! makes you think you are in the East; doesn't it?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1031#“A real harem, and not at all dear!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1032#“And the Smyrnas! oh, the Smyrnas! what tones, what delicacy!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1033#“And this Kurdestan! Just look, a Delacroix!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1034#The crowd was slowly diminishing. The bell, at an hour's interval,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1035#had already announced the two first dinners; the third was about to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1036#be served, and in the departments there were now only a few lingering
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1037#customers, whose fever for spending had made them forget the time.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1038#Outside nothing was heard but the rolling of the last carriages amidst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1039#the husky voice of Paris, the snort of a satiated ogre digesting the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1040#linens and cloths, silks and lace, with which he had been gorged since
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1041#the morning. Inside, beneath the flaming gas-jets, which, burning in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1042#the twilight, had lighted up the supreme efforts of the sale, everything
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1043#appeared like a field of battle still warm with the massacre of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1044#various goods. The salesmen, harassed and fatigued, camped amidst the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1045#contents of their shelves and counters, which appeared to have been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1046#thrown into the greatest confusion by the furious blast of a hurricane.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1047#It was with difficulty that one traversed the galleries on the ground
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1048#floor, blocked up with a crowd of chairs, and in the glove department it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1049#was necessary to step over a pile of cases heaped up around Mignot; in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1050#the woollen department there was no means of passing at all, Liénard was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1051#dozing on a sea of bales, in which certain piles, still standing,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1052#though half destroyed, seemed to be houses that an overflowing river was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1053#carrying away; and, further on, the linen department was like a heavy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1054#fall of snow, one ran up against icebergs of napkins, and walked on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1055#light flakes of handkerchiefs.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1056#The same disorder prevailed upstairs in the departments; the furs were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1057#scattered over the flooring, the readymade clothes were heaped up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1058#like the great-coats of wounded soldiers, the lace and the underlinen,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1059#unfolded, crumpled, thrown about everywhere, made one think of an army
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1060#of women who had disrobed there in the disorder of some sudden
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1061#desire; whilst downstairs, at the other end of the house, the delivery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1062#department in full activity was still disgorging the parcels with which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1063#it was bursting, and which were carried off by the vans--last vibration
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1064#of the overheated machine. But it was in the silk department especially
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1065#that the customers had flung themselves with the greatest ardour. There
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1066#they had cleared off everything, there was plenty of room to pass, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1067#hall was bare; the whole of the colossal stock of Paris Paradise had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1068#been cut up and carried away, as if by a swarm of devouring locusts. And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1069#in the midst of this emptiness, Hutin and Favier were running through
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1070#the counterfoils of their debit-notes, calculating their commission,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1071#still out of breath after the struggle. Favier had made fifteen francs,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1072#Hutin had only managed to make thirteen, thoroughly beaten that day,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1073#enraged at his bad luck. Their eyes sparkled with the passion for money.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1074#The whole shop around them was also adding up figures, glowing with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1075#same fever, in the brutal gaiety of the evening of the battle.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1076#“Well, Bourdoncle!” cried out Mouret, “are you trembling still?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1077#He had returned to his favourite position at the top of the stairs of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1078#the first floor, against the balustrade; and, in the presence of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1079#massacre of stuffs which was spread out under him, he indulged in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1080#victorious laugh. His fears of the morning, that moment of unpardonable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1081#weakness which nobody would ever know of, inspired him with a greater
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1082#desire to triumph. The battle was definitely won, the small tradespeople
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1083#of the neighbourhood were done for, and Baron Hartmann was conquered,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1084#with his millions and his land. Whilst he was looking at the cashiers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1085#bending over their ledgers, adding up long columns of figures, whilst he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1086#was listening to the sound of the gold, falling from their fingers into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1087#the metal bowls, he already saw The Ladies' Paradise growing beyond all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1088#bounds, enlarging its hall and prolonging its galleries as far as the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1089#Rue du Dix-Décembre.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1090#“And now are you convinced, Bourdoncle,” he resumed, “that the house is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1091#really too small? We could have sold twice as much.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1092#Bourdoncle humbled himself, enraptured, moreover, to find himself in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1093#wrong. But a new spectacle rendered them grave. As was the custom every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1094#evening, Lhomme, the chief cashier, had just collected the receipts
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1095#from each pay-desk; after having added them up, he usually posted up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1096#the total amount after placing the paper on which it was written on his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1097#file. He then took the receipts up to the chief cashier's office, in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1098#leather case and in bags, according to the nature of the cash. On this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1099#occasion the gold and silver predominated, and he was slowly walking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1100#upstairs, carrying three enormous bags. Deprived of his right arm, cut
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1101#off at the elbow, he clasped them in his left arm against his breast,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1102#holding one up with his chin to prevent it slipping. His heavy breathing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1103#could be heard at a distance, he passed along, staggering and superb,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1104#amidst the respectful shopmen.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1105#“How much, Lhomme?” asked Mouret.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1106#“Eighty thousand seven hundred and forty-two francs two sous,” replied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1107#the cashier.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1108#A joyous laugh stirred up The Ladies' Paradise. The amount ran through
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1109#the establishment. It was the highest figure ever attained in one day by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1110#a draper's shop.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1111#That evening, when Denise went up to bed, she was obliged to lean
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1112#against the partition in the corridor under the zinc roof. When in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1113#her room, and with the door closed, she fell down on the bed; her feet
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1114#pained her so much. For a long time she continued to look with a stupid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1115#air at the dressing-table, the wardrobe, all the hotel-like nudity.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1116#This, then, was where she was going to live; and her first day tormented
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1117#her--an abominable, endless day. She would never have the courage to go
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1118#through another. Then she perceived she was dressed in silk; and this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1119#uniform depressed her. She was childish enough, before unpacking her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1120#box, to put on her old woollen dress, which hung on the back of a chair.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1121#But when she was once more dressed in this poor garment of hers, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1122#painful emotion choked her; the sobs which she had kept back all day
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1123#burst forth suddenly in a flood of hot tears. She fell back on the bed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1124#weeping at the thought of the two children, and she wept on, without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1125#feeling to have the strength to take off her boots, completely overcome
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:iv.1126#with fatigue and grief.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1#CHAPTER V.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.2#The next day Denise had scarcely been downstairs half an hour, when
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.3#Madame Aurélie said to her in her sharp voice: “You are wanted at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.4#directorate, mademoiselle.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.5#The young girl found Mouret alone, in the large office hung with green
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.6#repp. He had suddenly remembered the “unkempt girl,” as Bourdoncle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.7#called her; and he, who usually detested the part of fault-finder, had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.8#had the idea of sending for her and waking her up a bit, if she were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.9#still dressed in the style of a country wench. The previous day,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.10#notwithstanding his pleasantry, he had experienced, in Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.11#Desforges's presence, a feeling of wounded vanity, on seeing the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.12#elegance of one of his saleswomen discussed. He felt a confused
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.13#sentiment, a mixture of sympathy and anger.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.14#“We have engaged you, mademoiselle,” commenced he, “out of regard for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.15#your uncle, and you must not put us under the sad necessity----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.16#But he stopped. Opposite him, on the other side of the desk, stood
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.17#Denise, upright, serious, and pale. Her silk dress was no longer too big
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.18#for her, but fitted tight round her pretty figure, displaying the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.19#pure lines of her virgin shoulders; and if her hair, knotted in thick
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.20#tresses, still appeared untidy, she tried at least to keep it in order.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.21#After having gone to sleep with her clothes on, her eyes red with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.22#weeping, the young girl had felt ashamed of this attack of nervous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.23#sensibility on waking up about four o'clock, and she had immediately
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.24#set about taking in her dress. She had spent an hour before the small
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.25#looking-glass, combing her hair, without being able to reduce it as she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.26#would have liked to.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.27#“Ah! thank heavens!” said Mouret, “you look better this morning. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.28#there's still that dreadful hair!” He rose from his seat and went up to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.29#her to try and smooth it down in the same familiar way Madame Aurélie
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.30#had attempted to do it the previous day. “There! just tuck that in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.31#behind your ear. The chignon is too high.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.32#She did not speak, but let him continue to arrange her hair;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.33#notwithstanding her vow to be strong, she had arrived at the office full
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.34#of misgivings, certain that she had been sent for to be informed of her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.35#dismissal. And Mouret's evident kindliness did not reassure her; she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.36#still felt afraid of him, feeling when near him that uneasiness which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.37#she attributed to a natural anxiety in the presence of a powerful man
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.38#on whom her fate depended. When he saw her so trembling under his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.39#hands, which were grazing her neck, he was sorry for his movement of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.40#good-nature, for he feared above all to lose his authority.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.41#“In short, mademoiselle,” resumed he, once more placing the desk between
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.42#himself and her, “try and look to your appearance. You are no longer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.43#at Valognes; study our Parisian young ladies. If your uncle's name has
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.44#sufficed to gain your admittance to our house, I feel sure you will
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.45#carry out what your person seemed to promise to me. Unfortunately,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.46#everybody here is not of my opinion. Let this be a warning to you. Don't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.47#make me tell a falsehood.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.48#He treated her like a child, with more pity than kindness, his curiosity
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.49#in matters feminine simply awakened by the troubling, womanly charm
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.50#which he felt springing up in this poor and awkward child. And she,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.51#whilst he was lecturing her, having suddenly perceived Madame Hedouin's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.52#portrait--the handsome regular face smiling gravely in the gold
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.53#frame--felt herself shivering again, notwithstanding the encouraging
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.54#words he addressed to her. This was the dead lady, she whom people
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.55#accused him of having killed, in order to found the house with the blood
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.56#of her body.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.57#Mouret was still speaking. “Now you may go,” said he at last, sitting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.58#down and taking up his pen. She went away, heaving a deep sigh of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.59#relief.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.60#From that day forward, Denise displayed her great courage. Beneath these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.61#rare attacks of sensitiveness, a strong sense of reason was constantly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.62#working, quite a feeling of bravery at finding herself weak and alone, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.63#cheerful determination to carry out her self-imposed task. She made very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.64#little noise, but went straight ahead to her goal, with an invincible
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.65#sweetness, overcoming all obstacles, and that simply and naturally, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.66#such was her real character.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.67#At first she had to surmount the terrible fatigues of the department The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.68#parcels of garments tired her arms, so much so that during the first
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.69#six weeks she cried with pain when she turned over at night, bent almost
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.70#double, her shoulders bruised. But she suffered still more from her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.71#shoes, thick shoes brought from Valognes, want of money preventing her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.72#replacing them with light boots. Always on her feet, trotting about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.73#from morning to night, scolded if seen leaning for a moment against any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.74#support, her feet became swollen, little feet, like those of a child,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.75#which seemed ground up in these torturing bluchers; her heels throbbed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.76#with fever, the soles were covered with blisters, the skin of which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.77#chafed off and stuck to the stocking. She felt her entire frame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.78#shattered, her limbs and organs contracted by the lassitude of her legs,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.79#the certain sudden weaknesses incident to her sex betraying themselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.80#by the paleness of her flesh. And she, so thin, so frail, resisted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.81#courageously, whilst a great many saleswomen around her were obliged
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.82#to quit the business, attacked with special maladies. Her good grace in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.83#suffering, her valiant obstinacy maintained her, smiling and upright,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.84#when she felt ready to give way, thoroughly worn out and exhausted by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.85#work to which men would have succumbed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.86#Another torment was to have the whole department against her. To
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.87#the physical martyrdom there was added the secret persecution of her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.88#comrades. Two months of patience and gentleness had not disarmed them.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.89#She was constantly exposed to wounding remarks, cruel inventions,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.90#a series of slights which cut her to the heart, in her longing for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.91#affection. They had joked for a long time over her unfortunate first
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.92#appearance; the words “clogs” and “numbskull” circulated. Those who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.93#missed a sale were sent to Valognes; she passed, in short, for the fool
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.94#of the place. Then, when she revealed herself later on as a remarkable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.95#saleswoman, well up in the mechanism of the house, the young ladies
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.96#arranged together so as never to leave her a good customer. Marguerite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.97#and Clara pursued her with an instinctive hatred, closing up the ranks
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.98#in order not to be swallowed up by this new comer, whom they really
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.99#feared in spite of their affectation of disdain. As for Madame Aurélie,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.100#she was hurt by the proud reserve displayed by the young girl, who did
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.101#not hover round her skirts with an air of caressing admiration; she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.102#therefore abandoned Denise to the rancour of her favourites, to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.103#favoured ones of her court, who were always on their knees, engaged in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.104#feeding her with a continual flattery, which her large authoritative
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.105#person needed to make it blossom forth. For a while, the second-hand,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.106#Madame Frédéric, appeared not to enter into the conspiracy, but this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.107#must have been by inadvertence, for she showed herself equally harsh the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.108#moment she saw to what annoyances her good-nature was likely to expose
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.109#her. Then the abandonment became complete, they all made a butt of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.110#“unkempt girl,” who lived in an hourly struggle, only managing by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.111#greatest courage to hold her own in the department.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.112#Such was her life now. She had to smile, look brave and gracious in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.113#silk dress which did not belong to her, although dying with fatigue,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.114#badly fed, badly treated, under the continual menace of a brutal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.115#dismissal. Her room was her only refuge, the only place where she could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.116#abandon herself to the luxury of a cry, when she had suffered too much
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.117#during the day. But a terrible coldness fell from the zinc roof, covered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.118#with the December snow; she was obliged to nestle in her iron bedstead,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.119#throw all her clothes over her, and weep under the counterpane to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.120#prevent the frost chapping her face. Mouret never spoke to her now. When
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.121#she caught Bourdoncle's severe looks during business hours she trembled,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.122#for she felt in him a born enemy who would not forgive her the slightest
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.123#fault. And amidst this general hostility, Jouve the inspector's strange
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.124#friendliness astonished her. If he met her in any out-of-the-way corner
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.125#he smiled at her, made some amiable remark; twice he had saved her from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.126#being reprimanded without any show of gratitude on her part, for she was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.127#more troubled than touched by his protection.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.128#One evening, after dinner, as the young ladies were setting the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.129#cupboards in order, Joseph came and informed Denise that a young man
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.130#wanted her below. She went down, feeling very anxious.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.131#“Hullo!” said Clara, “the 'unkempt girl' has got a young man.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.132#“He must be hard up for a sweetheart,” declared Marguerite.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.133#Downstairs, at the door, Denise found her brother Jean. She had formally
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.134#prohibited him from coming to the shop in this way, as it looked very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.135#bad. But she did not dare to scold him, so excited did he appear,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.136#bareheaded, out of breath through running from the Faubourg du Temple.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.137#“Have you got ten francs?” stammered he. “Give me ten francs, or I'm a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.138#lost man.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.139#The young rascal looked so comical, with his flowing locks and handsome
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.140#girlish face, launching out with this melodramatic phrase, that she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.141#could have smiled had it not been for the anguish which this demand for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.142#money caused her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.143#“What! ten francs?” she murmured. “Whatever's the matter?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.144#He blushed, and explained that he had met a friend's sister. Denise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.145#stopped him, feeling embarrassed, not wishing to know any more about it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.146#Twice already had he rushed in to obtain similar loans, but the first
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.147#time it was only twenty-five sous, and the next thirty. He was always
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.148#getting mixed up with women.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.149#“I can't give you ten francs,” resumed she. “Pépé's board isn't paid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.150#yet, and I've only just the money. I shall have hardly enough to buy a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.151#pair of boots, which I want badly. You really are not reasonable, Jean.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.152#It's too bad of you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.153#“Well, I'm lost,” repeated he, with a tragical gesture. “Just listen,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.154#little sister; she's a tall, dark girl; we went to the café with her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.155#brother. I never thought the drinks----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.156#She had to interrupt him again, and as tears were coming into his eyes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.157#she took out her purse and slipped a ten-franc piece into his hand. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.158#at once set up a laugh.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.159#“I was sure--But my word of honour! never again! A fellow would have to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.160#be a regular scamp.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.161#And he ran off, after having kissed his sister, like a madman. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.162#fellows in the shop seemed astonished.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.163#That night Denise did not sleep much. Since her entry in The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.164#Paradise, money had been her cruel anxiety. She was still a probationer,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.165#without salary; the young ladies in the department frequently prevented
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.166#her from selling, and she just managed to pay Pépé's board and lodging,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.167#thanks to the unimportant customers they were good enough to leave her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.168#It was a time of black misery--misery in a silk dress. She was often
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.169#obliged to spend the night repairing her small stack of clothes, darning
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.170#her linen, mending her chemises as if they had been lace; without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.171#mentioning the patches she put on her boots, as cleverly as any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.172#bootmaker could have done. She even risked washing things in her hand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.173#basin. But her old woollen dress was an especial cause of anxiety to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.174#her; she had no other, and was forced to put it on every evening when
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.175#she quitted the uniform silk, and this wore it terribly; a spot on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.176#it gave her the fever, the least tear was a catastrophe. And she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.177#nothing, not a sou, not even enough to buy the trifling articles which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.178#a woman always wants; she had been obliged to wait a fortnight to renew
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.179#her stock of needles and cotton. Thus it was a real disaster when Jean,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.180#with his love affairs, dropped down all at once and pillaged her purse.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.181#A franc-piece taken away caused a gulf which she did not know how
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.182#to fill up. As for finding ten francs on the morrow it was not to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.183#thought of for a moment. The whole night she slept an uncomfortable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.184#sleep, haunted by the nightmare, in which she saw Pépé thrown into the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.185#street, whilst she was turning over the flagstones with her bruised
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.186#fingers to see if there were not some money underneath.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.187#It happened that the next day she had to play the part of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.188#well-dressed girl. Some well-known customers came in, and Madame Aurélie
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.189#called her several times in order that she should show off the new
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.190#styles. And whilst she was posing there, with the stiff graces of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.191#fashion-plate, she was thinking of Pépé's board and lodging, which she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.192#had promised to pay that evening. She could very well do without boots
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.193#for another month; but even on adding the thirty francs she had left to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.194#the four francs which she had saved sou by sou, that would never make
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.195#more than thirty-four francs, and where was she to find six francs to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.196#complete the sum? It was an anguish in which her heart failed her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.197#“You will notice the shoulders are free,” Madame Aurélie was saying.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.198#“It's very fashionable and very convenient. The young person can fold
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.199#her arms.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.200#“Oh! easily,” replied Denise, who continued to smile amiably. “One can't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.201#feel it. I am sure you will like it, madame.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.202#She now blamed herself for having gone to fetch Pépé from Madame Gras's,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.203#the previous Sunday, to take him for a walk in the Champs-Elysées. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.204#poor child so seldom went out with her! But she had had to buy some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.205#gingerbread and a little spade, and then take him to see Punch and Judy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.206#and that had mounted at once to twenty-nine sous. Really Jean could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.207#not think much about the little one, or he would not be so foolish.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.208#Afterwards, everything fell upon her shoulders.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.209#“Of course, if it does not suit you, madame--” resumed the first-hand.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.210#“Just put this cloak on, mademoiselle, so that the lady may judge.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.211#And Denise walked slowly round, with the cloak on, saying: “This is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.212#warmer. It's this year's fashion.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.213#And she continued to torture herself, behind her professional good
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.214#graces, until the evening, to know where she was to find this money. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.215#young ladies, who were very busy, had left her an important sale; but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.216#it was only Tuesday, and she had four days to wait before drawing any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.217#money. After dinner she decided to postpone her visit to Madame Gras
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.218#till the next day. She would excuse herself, say she had been detained,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.219#and before then she would have the six francs, perhaps.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.220#As Denise avoided the slightest expense, she went to bed early. What
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.221#could she do in the streets, with her unsociableness, still frightened
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.222#by the big city in which she only knew the streets near the shop? After
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.223#having ventured as far as the Palais-Royal, to get a little fresh air,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.224#she would quickly return, lock herself in her room and set about sewing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.225#or washing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.226#It was, along the corridor of the bed-rooms, a barrack-like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.227#promiscuity--girls, who were often not very tidy, a gossiping over dirty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.228#water and dirty linen, quite a disagreeable feeling, which manifested
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.229#itself in frequent quarrels and continual reconciliations. They were,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.230#moreover, prohibited from going up to their rooms in the day-time; they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.231#did not live there, but merely slept there at night, not going up till
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.232#the last minute, leaving again in the morning still half asleep, hardly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.233#awakened by a rapid wash; and this gust of wind which was continually
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.234#sweeping through the corridor, the fatigue of the thirteen hours' work
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.235#which threw them on their beds thoroughly worn out, changed this upper
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.236#part of the house into an inn traversed by the tired ill-temper of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.237#host of travellers. Denise had no friend. Of all the young ladies,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.238#one alone, Pauline Cugnot, showed her a certain tenderness; and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.239#ready-made and under-clothing departments being close to one another,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.240#and in open war, the sympathy between the two saleswomen had hitherto
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.241#been confined to a few rare words hastily exchanged. Pauline occupied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.242#a neighbouring room, to the right of Denise's; but as she disappeared
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.243#immediately after dinner and only returned at eleven o'clock, the latter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.244#only heard her get into bed, without ever meeting her after business
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.245#hours.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.246#This evening, Denise had made up her mind to play the part of bootmaker
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.247#once more. She was holding her shoes, turning them about, wondering how
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.248#she could make them last another month. At last she decided to take a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.249#strong needle and sew on the soles, which were threatening to leave the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.250#uppers. During this time a collar and a pair of cuffs were soaking in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.251#the basin full of soapsuds.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.252#Every evening she heard the same noises, the young ladies coming in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.253#one by one, short whispered conversations, laughing, and sometimes a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.254#dispute, which they stifled as much as possible. Then the beds creaked,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.255#the tired occupants yawned, and fell into a heavy slumber. Denise's left
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.256#hand neighbour often talked in her sleep, which frightened her very much
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.257#at first Perhaps others, like herself, stopped up to mend their things,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.258#in spite of the rules; but if so they probably took the same precautions
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.259#as she did herself, keeping very quiet, avoiding the least shock, for a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.260#shivering silence reigned in all the rooms.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.261#It had struck eleven about ten minutes before when a sound of footsteps
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.262#made her raise her head. Another young lady late! And she recognised it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.263#to be Pauline, by hearing the latter open the door next to her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.264#But she was astonished when Pauline returned quietly and knocked at her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.265#door.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.266#“Make haste, it's me!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.267#The saleswomen not being allowed to visit each other in their rooms,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.268#Denise quickly unlocked the door, so that her neighbour should not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.269#be caught by Madame Cabin, who was supposed to see this rule strictly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.270#carried out.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.271#“Was she there?” asked Denise, closing the door.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.272#“Who? Madame Cabin?” replied Pauline. “Oh, I'm not afraid of her, she's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.273#easily settled with a five-franc-piece!” Then she added: “I've wanted to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.274#have a talk with you for a long time past. But it's impossible to do so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.275#downstairs. Besides, you looked so down-hearted to-night at table.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.276#Denise thanked her, and invited her to sit down, touched by her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.277#good-natured air. But in the trouble caused by the sudden visit she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.278#not laid down the shoe she was mending, and Pauline's eyes fell on it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.279#at once. She shook her head, looked round and perceived the collar and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.280#cuffs in the basin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.281#“My poor child, I thought as much,” resumed she. “Ah, I know what it is!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.282#When I first came up from Chartres, and old Cugnot didn't send me a sou,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.283#I many a time washed my own chemises! Yes, yes, even my chemises! I had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.284#two, and there was always one in soak.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.285#She sat down, still out of breath from running. Her large face,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.286#with small bright eyes, and big tender mouth, had a certain grace,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.287#notwithstanding the rather coarse features. And, without transition,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.288#all of a sudden, she related her history; her childhood at the mill; old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.289#Cugnot ruined by a lawsuit; her being sent to Paris to make her fortune
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.290#with twenty francs in her pocket; then her start as a shop-girl in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.291#shop at Batignolles, then at The Ladies' Paradise--a terrible start, all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.292#the sufferings and all the privations imaginable; she then spoke of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.293#her present life, of the two hundred francs she earned a month, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.294#pleasures she indulged in, the carelessness in which she allowed her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.295#days to glide away. Some jewellery, a brooch, a watch-chain, glistened
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.296#on her dark-blue cloth dress, coquettishly made to the figure; and she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.297#wore a velvet hat, ornamented with a large grey feather.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.298#Denise had turned very red, with her shoe. She began to stammer out an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.299#explanation.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.300#“But the same thing happened to me,” repeated Pauline.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.301#“Come, come, I'm older than you, I'm over twenty-six, though I don't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.302#look it. Just tell me your little troubles.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.303#Denise yielded, conquered by this friendship so frankly offered. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.304#sat down in her petticoat, with an old shawl over her shoulders, near
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.305#Pauline in full dress; and an interesting gossip ensued.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.306#It was freezing in the room, the cold seemed to run down the bare
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.307#prison-like walls; but they did not notice that their fingers were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.308#almost frost-bitten, they were so fully taken up by their conversation.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.309#Little by little, Denise opened her heart entirely, spoke of Jean and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.310#Pépé, and how much the money question tortured her; which led them both
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.311#to abuse the young ladies in the dress department. Pauline relieved her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.312#mind.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.313#“Oh, the hussies! If they treated you properly and in a friendly manner,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.314#you could make more than a hundred francs a month.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.315#“Everybody is down on me, and I'm sure I don't know why,” said Denise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.316#beginning to cry. “Look at Monsieur Bourdoncle, he's always watching me
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.317#for a chance of finding me in fault, as if I were in his way. Old Jouve
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.318#is about the only one----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.319#The other interrupted her. “What, that old monkey of an inspector! Ah!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.320#my dear, don't you trust him. You know, men with big noses like his! He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.321#may display his decoration as much as he likes, there's a story about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.322#something that happened to him in our department. But what a child you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.323#are to grieve like this! What a misfortune it is to be so sensitive! Of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.324#course, what is happening to you happens to every one; they are making
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.325#you pay your footing.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.326#She seized her hands and kissed her, carried away by her good heart The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.327#money-question was a graver one. Certainly a poor girl could not support
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.328#her two brothers, pay the little one's board and lodging, and regale the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.329#big one's mistresses with the few paltry sous picked up from the others'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.330#cast-off customers; for it was to be feared that she would not get any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.331#salary until business improved in March.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.332#“Listen to me, it's impossible for you to live in this way any longer.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.333#If I were you----” said Pauline.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.334#But a noise in the corridor stopped her. It was probably Marguerite, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.335#was accused of prowling about at night to watch the others. Pauline,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.336#who was still pressing her friend's hand, looked at her for a moment in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.337#silence, listening. Then she resumed in a very low tone, with an air of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.338#tender conviction: “If I were you I should take some one.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.339#“How some one?” murmured Denise, not understanding at first.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.340#When she understood, she withdrew her hands, looking very confused. This
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.341#advice made her feel awkward, like an idea which had never occurred to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.342#her, and of which she could not see the advantage.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.343#“Oh! no,” replied she simply.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.344#“Then,” continued Pauline, “you'll never manage, I tell you so, plainly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.345#Here are the figures: forty francs for the little one, a five franc
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.346#piece now and again for the big one; and then there's yourself, you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.347#can't always go about dressed like a pauper, with boots that make the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.348#other girls laugh at you; yes, really, your boots do you a deal of harm.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.349#Take some one, it would be much better.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.350#“No,” repeated Denise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.351#“Well! you are very foolish. It's inevitable, my dear, and so natural.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.352#We all do it sooner or later. Look at me, I was a probationer, like you,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.353#without a sou. We are boarded and lodged, it's true; but there's our
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.354#dress; besides, it's impossible to go without a copper in one's pocket,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.355#shut up in one's room, watching the flies. So you see girls forcibly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.356#drift into it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.357#She then spoke of her first lover, a lawyer's clerk whom she had met at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.358#a party at Meudon. After him, came a post-office clerk. And, finally,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.359#ever since the autumn, she had been keeping company with a salesman at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.360#the Bon Marche, a very nice tall fellow, with whom she spent all her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.361#leisure time. Never more than one sweetheart at a time, however. She was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.362#very respectable in her way, and became indignant when she heard talk of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.363#those girls who yielded to the first-comer.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.364#“I don't tell you to misconduct yourself, you know!” said she quickly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.365#“For instance, I should not like to be seen with your Clara, for fear
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.366#people should say I was as bad as she. But when a girl stays quietly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.367#with one lover, and has nothing to blame herself for--do you think that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.368#wrong?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.369#“No,” replied Denise. “But I don't care for it, that's all.” There was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.370#a fresh silence. In the small icy-cold room they were smiling to each
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.371#other, greatly affected by this whispered conversation. “Besides, one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.372#must have some affection for some one before doing so,” resumed she, her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.373#cheeks scarlet.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.374#Pauline was astonished. She set up a laugh, and embraced her a second
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.375#time, saying: “But, my darling, when you meet and like each other! You
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.376#are funny! People won't force you. Look here, would you like Bauge
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.377#to take us somewhere in the country on Sunday? He'll bring one of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.378#friends.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.379#“No,” said Denise, in her gently obstinate way.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.380#Pauline insisted no longer. Each one was free to act as she liked. What
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.381#she had said was out of pure kindness of heart, for she felt really
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.382#grieved to see a comrade so miserable. And as it was nearly midnight,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.383#she got up to leave. But before doing so she forced Denise to accept the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.384#six francs she wanted, begging her not to trouble about the matter, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.385#to repay the amount when she earned more.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.386#“Now,” added she, “blow your candle out, so that they can't see which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.387#door opens; you can light it again immediately.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.388#The candle blown out, they shook hands; and Pauline ran off to her room,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.389#without leaving any trace in the darkness but the vague rustling of her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.390#petticoats amidst the deep slumber of the occupants of the other little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.391#rooms.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.392#Before going to bed Denise wanted to finish her boot and do her washing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.393#The cold became sharper still as the night advanced; but she did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.394#feel it, this conversation had stirred up her heart's blood. She was not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.395#shocked, it seemed to her that every one had a right to arrange her life
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.396#as she liked, when alone and free in the world. She had never given way
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.397#to such ideas; her sense of right and her healthy nature maintained her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.398#naturally in the respectability in which she had always lived. About one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.399#o'clock she at last went to bed. No, she did not love any one. So what
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.400#was the use of disarranging her life, of spoiling the maternal devotion
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.401#she had vowed for her two brothers? However, she did not sleep; a crowd
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.402#of indistinct forms passed before her closed eyes, vanishing in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.403#darkness.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.404#From this moment Denise took an interest in the love-stories of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.405#department. During the slack moments they were constantly occupied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.406#by their affairs with the men. Gossiping tales flew about, stories of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.407#adventures amused the girls for a week. Clara was a scandal; she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.408#three lovers, without counting a string of chance admirers whom she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.409#in tow; and, if she did not leave the shop, where she did the least work
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.410#possible, disdaining the money which she could easily and more agreeably
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.411#earn elsewhere, it was to shield herself from her family; for she was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.412#mortally afraid of old Prunaire, who threatened to come to Paris and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.413#break her arms and legs with his clogs. Marguerite, on the contrary,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.414#behaved very well, and was not known to have any lover; this caused
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.415#some surprise, for all knew of her adventure--her coming to Paris to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.416#confined in secret; how had she come to have the child, if she were so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.417#virtuous? And there were some who hinted at an accident, adding that she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.418#was now reserving herself for her cousin at Grenoble. The young ladies
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.419#also joked about Madame Frédéric, declaring that she was discreetly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.420#connected with certain great personages; the truth was that they knew
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.421#nothing of her love-affairs; for she disappeared every evening, stiff
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.422#as starch in her widow's ill-temper, evidently in a great hurry, though
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.423#nobody knew where she was running off to so eagerly. As to Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.424#Aurélie's passions, her pretended larks with obedient young men, they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.425#were certainly false; mere inventions, spread abroad by discontented
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.426#saleswomen just for fun. Perhaps she had formerly displayed rather too
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.427#much motherly feeling for one of her son's friends, but she now occupied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.428#too high a place in the drapery business to allow her to amuse herself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.429#with such childish matters. Then there was the crowd leaving in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.430#evening, nine girls out of every ten having young men waiting for them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.431#at the door; in the Place Gaillon, along the Rue de la Michodière, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.432#the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin, there was always quite a troop of men
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.433#standing motionless, watching for the girls coming out; and, when they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.434#came, each one gave his arm to his lady and disappeared, talking with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.435#marital tranquillity.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.436#But what troubled Denise most was to have discovered Colomban's secret.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.437#He was continually to be seen on the other side of the street, at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.438#door of The Old Elbeuf, his eyes raised, and never quitting the young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.439#ladies in the readymade department. When he felt Denise was watching him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.440#he blushed and turned away his head, as if afraid she might betray him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.441#to Geneviève, although there had been no further connection between the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.442#Baudus and their niece since her engagement at The Ladies' Paradise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.443#At first she had thought he was in love with Marguerite, on seeing his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.444#despairing looks, for Marguerite, being very quiet, and sleeping in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.445#building, was not very easy to get at. But what was her astonishment to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.446#find that Colomban's ardent glances were intended for Clara. He had been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.447#like that for months, devoured by passion on the opposite side of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.448#way, without finding the courage to declare himself; and that for a girl
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.449#who was perfectly free, who lived in the Rue Louis-le-Grand, and whom he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.450#could have spoken to any evening before she walked off on the arm of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.451#fresh fellow! Clara herself appeared to have no idea of her conquest.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.452#Denise's discovery filled her with a painful emotion. Was love, then,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.453#such a stupid thing as that? What! this fellow, who had real
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.454#happiness within his reach, was ruining his life, enraptured with this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.455#good-for-nothing girl as if she were a saint! From that day she was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.456#seized with a feeling of grief every time she saw Geneviève's pale and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.457#suffering face behind the green panes of The Old Elbeuf.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.458#In the evening, Denise could not help thinking a great deal, on seeing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.459#the young ladies march off with their sweethearts Those who did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.460#sleep at The Ladies' Paradise, disappeared until the next day, bringing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.461#back into their departments an outside odour, a sort of troubling,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.462#unknown impression. The young girl was sometimes obliged to reply with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.463#a smile to a friendly nod from Pauline, whom Bauge waited for every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.464#evening regularly at half-past eight, at the corner of the fountain
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.465#in the Place Gaillon. Then, after having gone out the last and taken
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.466#a furtive walk, always alone, she was invariably the first in, going
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.467#upstairs to work, or to bed, her head filled with dreams, full of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.468#curiosity about this outdoor life, of which she knew nothing. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.469#certainly did not envy the young ladies, she was happy in her solitude,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.470#in that unsociableness to which her timidity condemned her, as to a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.471#refuge; but her imagination carried her away, she tried to guess things,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.472#evoking the pleasures constantly described before her, the cafés, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.473#restaurants, the theatres, the Sundays spent on the water and in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.474#country taverns. This filled her with a mental weakness, a desire
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.475#mingled with lassitude; and she seemed to be already tired of those
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.476#amusements which she had never tasted.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.477#However, there was but little room for these dangerous dreams in her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.478#daily working life. During the thirteen hours' hard work in the shop,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.479#there was no time for any display of tenderness between the salesmen and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.480#the saleswomen. If the continual fight for money had not abolished the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.481#sexes, the unceasing press of business which occupied their minds and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.482#fatigued their bodies would have sufficed to kill all desire. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.483#very few love-affairs had been known in the establishment amidst the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.484#hostilities and friendships between the men and the women, the constant
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.485#elbowings from department to department. They were all nothing but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.486#the wheels, turned round by the immense machine, abdicating their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.487#personalities, simply contributing their strength to this commonplace,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.488#powerful total. It was only outside that they resumed their individual
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.489#lives, with the abrupt flame of awakening passions.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.490#Denise, however, one day saw Albert Lhomme slipping a note into the hand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.491#of a young lady in the underclothing department, after having several
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.492#times passed through with an air of indifference. The dead season, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.493#lasts from December to February was commencing; and she had periods of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.494#rest, hours spent on her feet, her eyes wandering all over the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.495#shop, waiting for customers. The young ladies of her department were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.496#especially friendly with the salesmen who served the lace, but their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.497#intimacy never went any further than some rather risky jokes, exchanged
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.498#in whispers. In the lace department there was a second-hand, a gay youth
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.499#who pursued Clara with all sorts of abominable stories, simply for a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.500#joke--so careless at heart that he made no effort to meet her outside;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.501#and thus it was from counter to counter, between the gentlemen and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.502#young ladies, a series of winks, nods, and remarks, which they alone
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.503#understood. At times they indulged in some sly gossip with their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.504#backs half turned and with a dreamy air, in order to put the terrible
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.505#Bourdoncle off the scent As for Deloche, for a long time he contented
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.506#him self with smiling at Denise when he met her; but, getting bolder,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.507#he occasionally murmured a friendly word. The day she had noticed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.508#Madame Aurélie's son giving a note to the young lady in the under-linen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.509#department, Deloche was asking her if she had enjoyed her lunch, feeling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.510#to want to say something, and unable to find anything more amiable.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.511#He also saw the white paper; and looking at the young girl, they both
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.512#blushed at this intrigue carried on before them.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.513#But under these rumours which gradually awoke the woman in her, Denise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.514#still retained her infantine peace of mind. The one thing that stirred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.515#her heart was meeting with Hutin. But even that was only gratitude
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.516#in her eyes; she simply thought herself touched by the young man's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.517#politeness. He could not bring a customer to the department without her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.518#feeling quite confused. Several times, on returning from a pay-desk, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.519#found herself making a _détour_, uselessly passing the silk counter,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.520#her bosom heaving with emotion. One afternoon she met Mouret there, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.521#seemed to follow her with a smile. He paid no more attention to her now,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.522#only addressing a few words to her from time to time, to give her a few
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.523#hints about her toilet, and to joke with her, as an impossible girl, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.524#little savage almost like a boy, of whom he would never make a coquette,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.525#notwithstanding all his knowledge of women; sometimes he even ventured
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.526#to laugh at and tease her, without wishing to acknowledge to himself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.527#the charm which this little saleswoman inspired in him, with her comical
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.528#head of hair. Before this mute smile, Denise trembled, as if she were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.529#in fault Did he know why she was going through the silk department, when
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.530#she could not herself have explained what made her make such a _détour?_
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.531#Hutin, moreover, did not seem to be aware in any way of the young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.532#girl's grateful looks. The shop-girls were not his style, he affected to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.533#despise them, boasting more than ever of extraordinary adventures with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.534#the lady customers; a baroness had been struck with him at his counter,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.535#and the wife of an architect had fallen into his arms one day when he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.536#went to her house about an error in measuring he had made. Beneath
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.537#this Norman boasting he simply concealed girls picked up in cafés and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.538#music-halls. Like all young gentlemen in the drapery line, he had a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.539#mania for spending, fighting in his department the whole week with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.540#miser's greediness, with the sole wish to squander his money on Sunday
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.541#on the racecourses, in the restaurants, and dancing-saloons; never
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.542#thinking of saving a penny, spending his salary as soon as he drew it,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.543#absolutely indifferent about the future. Favier did not join him in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.544#these parties. Hutin and he, so friendly in the shop, bowed to each
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.545#other at the door, where all further intercourse ceased. A great many of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.546#the shopmen, in continual contact indoors, became strangers, ignorant of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.547#each other's lives, as soon as they set foot in the streets. But Liénard
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.548#was Hutin's intimate friend. Both lived in the same lodging-house,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.549#the Hôtel de Smyrne, in the Rue Sainte-Anne, a murky building entirely
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.550#inhabited by shop assistants. In the morning they arrived together;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.551#then, in the evening, the first one free, after the folding was done,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.552#waited for the other at the Cafe Saint-Roch, in the Rue Saint-Roch, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.553#little café where the employees of The Ladies' Paradise usually met,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.554#brawling, drinking, and playing cards amidst the smoke of their pipes.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.555#They often stopped there till one in the morning, until the tired
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.556#landlord turned them out. For the last month they had been spending
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.557#three evenings a week at a free-and-easy at Montmartre; and they took
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.558#their friends with them, creating a success for Mademoiselle Laure, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.559#music-hall singer. Hutin's latest conquest, whose talent they applauded
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.560#with such violent blows and such a clamour that the police had been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.561#obliged to interfere on two occasions.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.562#The winter passed in this way, and Denise at last obtained three hundred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.563#francs a-year fixed salary. It was quite time, for her shoes were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.564#completely worn out. For the last month she had avoided going out, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.565#fear of bursting them entirely.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.566#“What a noise you make with your shoes, mademoiselle!” Madame Aurélie
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.567#very often remarked, with an irritated look. “It's intolerable. What's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.568#the matter with your feet?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.569#The day Denise appeared with a pair of cloth boots, for which she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.570#given five francs, Marguerite and Clara expressed their astonishment in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.571#a kind of half whisper, so as to be heard.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.572#“Hullo! the 'unkempt girl' has given up her goloshes,” said the one.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.573#“Ah,” retorted the other, “she must have cried over them. They were her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.574#mother's.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.575#In point of fact, there was a general uprising against Denise. The girls
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.576#of her department had found out her friendship with Pauline, and thought
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.577#they saw a certain bravado in this affection displayed for a saleswoman
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.578#of a rival counter. They spoke of treason, accused her of going and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.579#repeating their slightest words. The war between the two departments
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.580#became more violent than ever, it had never waxed so warm; hard words
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.581#were exchanged like cannon-balls, and there was even a slap given one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.582#evening behind some boxes of chemises. Perhaps this remote quarrel arose
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.583#from the fact that the young ladies in the under-linen department wore
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.584#woollen dresses, whilst those in the ready-made one wore silk. In any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.585#case, the former spoke of their neighbours with the shocked air of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.586#respectable girls; and facts proved that they were right, for it had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.587#been remarked that the silk dresses appeared to have a certain influence
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.588#on the dissolute habits of the young ladies who wore them. Clara was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.589#taunted with her troop of lovers, even Marguerite had, so to say, had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.590#her child thrown in her face, whilst Madame Frédéric was accused of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.591#all sorts of concealed passions. And this was solely on account of that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.592#Denise!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.593#“Now, young ladies, no ugly words; behave yourselves!” Madame Aurélie
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.594#would say with her imperial air, amidst the rising passions of her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.595#little kingdom. “Show who you are.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.596#At heart she preferred to remain neutral. As she confessed one day, when
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.597#talking to Mouret, these girls were all about the same, one was as good
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.598#as the other. But she suddenly became impassioned when she learnt from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.599#Bourdoncle that he had just caught her son downstairs kissing a young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.600#girl belonging to the under-linen department, the saleswoman to whom he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.601#had passed several letters. It was abominable, and she roundly accused
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.602#the under-linen department of having laid a trap for Albert. Yes, it was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.603#a got-up affair against herself, they were trying to dishonour her by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.604#ruining a child without experience, after seeing that it was impossible
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.605#to attack her department. Her only object in making such a noise was to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.606#complicate the business, for she knew what her son was, fully aware
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.607#that he was capable of doing all sorts of stupid things. For a time the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.608#matter assumed a grave aspect, Mignot, the glove salesman, was mixed up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.609#in it. He was a great friend of Albert's, and the rumour got circulated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.610#that he favoured the mistresses Albert sent him, girls with big
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.611#chignons, who rummaged in the boxes for hours together; and there was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.612#also a story about some Swedish kid gloves given to the girl of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.613#under-linen department which was never properly cleared up. At last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.614#the scandal was hushed up out of regard for Madame Aurélie, whom Mouret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.615#himself treated with deference. Bourdoncle contented himself a week
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.616#after with dismissing, for some slight offence, the girl who allowed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.617#herself to be kissed. If they shut their eyes to the terrible doings
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.618#of their employees outdoors, the managers did not tolerate the least
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.619#nonsense in the house.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.620#And it was Denise who suffered for all this. Madame Aurélie, although
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.621#perfectly well aware of what was going on, nourished a secret rancour
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.622#against her; she saw her laughing one evening with Pauline, and took
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.623#it for bravado, concluding that they were gossiping over her son's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.624#love-affairs. And she caused the young girl to be isolated more than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.625#ever in the department. For some time she had been thinking of inviting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.626#the young ladies to spend a Sunday near Rambouillet, at Rigolles, where
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.627#she had bought a country house with the first hundred thousand francs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.628#she had saved; and she suddenly decided to do so; it would be a means
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.629#of punishing Denise, of putting her openly on one side. She was the only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.630#one not invited. For a fortnight in advance, nothing was talked of but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.631#this party; the girls kept their eyes on the sky, and had already
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.632#mapped out the whole day, looking forward to all sorts of pleasures:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.633#donkey-riding, milk and brown bread. And they were to be all women,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.634#which was more amusing still! As a rule, Madame Aurélie killed her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.635#holidays in this way, going out with her lady friends; for she was so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.636#little accustomed to being at home, she always felt so uncomfortable, so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.637#strange, during the rare occasions she could dine with her husband and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.638#son, that she preferred to throw up even those occasions, and go and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.639#dine at a restaurant. Lhomme went his own way, enraptured to resume
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.640#his bachelor existence, and Albert, greatly relieved, went off with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.641#his beauties; so that, unaccustomed to being at home, feeling in each
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.642#other's way, and wearying each other when together on a Sunday, they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.643#paid nothing more than a flying visit to the house, as to some common
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.644#hôtel where people take a bed for the night. Regarding the excursion
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.645#to Rambouillet, Madame Aurélie simply declared that propriety prevented
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.646#Albert joining them, and that the father himself would display great
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.647#tact by refusing to come; a declaration which enchanted the two men.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.648#However, the happy day was drawing near, and the young girls chattered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.649#more than ever, relating their preparations in the way of dress, as if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.650#they were going on a six months' tour, whilst Denise had to listen to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.651#them, pale and silent in her abandonment.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.652#“Ah, they make you wild, don't they?” said Pauline to her one morning.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.653#“If I were you I would just catch them nicely! They are going to enjoy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.654#themselves. I would enjoy myself too. Come with us on Sunday, Bauge is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.655#going to take me to Joinville.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.656#“No, thanks,” said the young girl with her quiet obstinacy.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.657#“But why not? Are you still afraid of being taken by force?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.658#And Pauline, laughed heartily. Denise also smiled. She knew how such
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.659#things came about; it was always during some similar excursions that the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.660#young ladies had made the acquaintance of their first lovers, brought by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.661#chance by a friend; and she did not want to.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.662#“Come,” resumed Pauline, “I assure you that Bauge won't bring any one.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.663#We shall be all by ourselves. As you don't want to, I won't go and marry
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.664#you off, of course.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.665#Denise hesitated, tormented by such a strong desire to go that the blood
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.666#flew to her cheeks. Since the girls had been talking about their country
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.667#pleasures she had felt stifled, overcome by a longing for fresh air,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.668#dreaming of the tall grass into which she could sink down up to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.669#neck, of the giant trees the shadows of which should flow over her like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.670#so much cooling water. Her childhood, spent in the rich verdure of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.671#Cotentin, was awakening with a regret for sun and air.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.672#“Well! yes,” said she at last.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.673#Everything was soon arranged. Bauge was to come and fetch them at eight
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.674#o'clock, in the Place Gaillon; from there they would take a cab to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.675#Vincennes Station. Denise, whose twenty-five francs a month was quickly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.676#swallowed up by the children, had only been able to do up her old black
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.677#woollen dress, by trimming it with strips of check poplin; and she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.678#also made herself a bonnet, a shape covered with silk and ornamented
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.679#with a simple blue ribbon. In this simple attire she looked very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.680#young, like an overgrown girl, exceedingly clean, rather shamefaced and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.681#embarrassed by her luxuriant hair, which appeared through the nakedness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.682#of her bonnet.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.683#Pauline, on the contrary, displayed a pretty violet and white striped
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.684#silk dress, a hat richly trimmed and laden with feathers, jewels round
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.685#her neck and rings on her fingers, which gave her the appearance of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.686#well-to-do tradesman's wife. It was like a Sunday revenge on the woollen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.687#dress she was obliged to wear all the week in the shop; whilst Denise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.688#who wore her uniform silk from Monday to Saturday, resumed, on Sunday,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.689#her thin woollen dress of misery.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.690#“There's Bauge,” said Pauline, pointing to a tall fellow standing near
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.691#the fountain.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.692#She introduced her lover, and Denise felt at her ease at once, he seemed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.693#such a nice fellow. Bauge, big, strong as an ox, had a long Flemish
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.694#face, in which his expressionless eyes twinkled with an infantine
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.695#puerility. Born at Dunkerque, the younger son of a grocer, he had come
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.696#to Paris, almost turned out by his father and brother, who thought him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.697#a fearful dunce. However, he made three thousand five hundred francs a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.698#year at the Bon Marche. He was rather stupid, but a very good hand in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.699#the linen department. The women thought him nice.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.700#“And the cab?” asked Pauline.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.701#They had to go as far as the Boulevard. It was already rather warm
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.702#in the sun, the glorious May morning seemed to laugh on the street
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.703#pavement. There was not a cloud in the sky; quite a gaiety floated in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.704#the blue air, transparent as crystal. An involuntary smile played on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.705#Denise's lips; she breathed freely; it seemed to her that her bosom was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.706#throwing off the stifling sensation of six months. At last she no
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.707#longer felt the stuffy air and the heavy stones of The Ladies' Paradise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.708#weighing her down! She had then the prospect of a long day in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.709#country before her! and it was like a new lease of life, an endless joy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.710#into which she entered with all the glee of a little child. However,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.711#when in the cab, she turned her eyes away, feeling very awkward as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.712#Pauline bent over to kiss her lover.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.713#“Oh, look!” said she, her head still at the window, “there's Monsieur
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.714#Lhomme. How he does walk!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.715#“He's got his French horn,” added Pauline, leaning out. “What an old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.716#stupid! One would think he was running to meet his girl!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.717#Lhomme, with his instrument under his arm, was spinning along past
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.718#the Gymnase Theatre, his nose in the air, laughing with delight at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.719#thought of the treat in store for him. He was going to spend the day at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.720#a friend's, a flautist at a small theatre, where a few amateurs indulged
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.721#in a little chamber music on Sundays as soon as breakfast was over.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.722#“At eight o'clock! what a madman!” resumed Pauline. “And you know that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.723#Madame Aurélie and all her clique must have taken the Rambouillet train
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.724#that left at half-past six. It's very certain the husband and wife won't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.725#come across each other.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.726#Both then commenced talking of the Rambouillet excursion. They did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.727#wish it to be rainy for the others, because they themselves would be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.728#obliged to suffer as well; but if a cloud could burst over there without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.729#extending to Joinville, it would be funny all the same. Then they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.730#attacked Clara, a dirty slut, who hardly knew how to spend the money
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.731#her men gave her: hadn't she bought three pairs of boots all at the same
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.732#time, which she threw away the next day, after having cut them with her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.733#scissors, on account of her feet, which were covered with bunions. In
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.734#fact, the young ladies were just as bad as the fellows, they squandered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.735#everything, never saving a son, wasting two or three hundred francs a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.736#month on dress and dainties.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.737#“But he's only got one arm,” said Bauge all of a sudden. “How does he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.738#manage to play the French horn?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.739#He had kept his eyes on Lhomme. Pauline, who sometimes amused herself by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.740#playing on his stupidity, told him the cashier kept the instrument up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.741#by placing it against a wall. He thoroughly believed her, and thought it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.742#very ingenious. Then, when stricken with remorse, she explained to him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.743#in what way Lhomme had adapted to his stump a system of keys which he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.744#made use of as a hand, he shook his head, full of suspicion, declaring
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.745#that they wouldn't make him swallow that.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.746#“You are ready too stupid!” she retorted, laughingly. “Never mind, I love
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.747#you all the same.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.748#They reached the Vincennes Station just in time for a train. Bauge paid;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.749#but Denise had previously declared that she washed to pay her share
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.750#of the expenses; they would settle up in the evening. They took
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.751#second-class tickets, and found the train full of a gay noisy throng.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.752#At Nogent, a wedding-party got out, amidst a storm of laughter. At last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.753#they arrived at Joinville and went straight to the island to order
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.754#lunch; and they stopped there, lingering on the banks of the Marne,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.755#under the tall poplars. It was rather cold in the shade, a sharp breese
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.756#was blowing in the sunshine, extending far into the distance, on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.757#other side of the river, the limpid parity of a plain dotted with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.758#cultivated fields. Denise lingered behind Pauline and her lover, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.759#were walking with their arms round each others waists. She had picked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.760#a handful of buttercups, and was watching the view of the river, happy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.761#her heart beating, her head drooping, each time Baugé leant over to kiss
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.762#his mistress. Her eyes filled with tears. And yet she was not suffering.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.763#What was the matter with her that she had this feeling of suffocation?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.764#and why did this vast landscape, where she had looked forward to having
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.765#so much enjoyment, fill her with a vague regret she could not explain?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.766#Then, at lunch, Pauline's noisy laugh bewildered her. That young lady,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.767#who loved the suburbs with the passion of an actress living in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.768#gas-light, in the thick air of a crowd, wanted to lunch in an arbour,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.769#notwithstanding the sharp wind. She was delighted with the sudden gusts
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.770#which blew up the table-cloth, she thought the arbour very funny in its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.771#nudity, with the freshly-painted trelliswork, the lozenges of which cast
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.772#a reflection on the cloth. She ate ravenously, devouring everything with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.773#the voracity of a girl badly fed at the shop, making up for it outside
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.774#by giving herself an indigestion with the things she liked; this was her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.775#vice, she spent most of her money in cakes and indigestible dainties
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.776#of all kinds, favourite dishes stowed away in her leisure moments. As
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.777#Denise seemed to have had enough of the eggs, fried fish, and stewed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.778#chicken, she restrained herself, not daring to order any strawberries, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.779#luxury still very dear, for fear of running the bill up too high.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.780#“Now, what are we going to do?” asked Baugé when the coffee was served.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.781#As a rule Pauline and he returned to Paris to dine, and finish their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.782#day in some theatre. But at Denise's request, they decided to stay at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.783#Joinville all day; they would be able to have their fill of the country.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.784#So they stopped and wandered about the fields all the afternoon. They
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.785#spoke for a moment of going for a row, but abandoned the idea; Baugé was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.786#not a good waterman. But they found themselves walking along the banks
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.787#of the Marne, all the same, and were greatly interested by the life on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.788#the river, the squadrons of yawls and other boats, and the young men
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.789#who formed the crews. The sun was going down, they were returning to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.790#Joinville, when they saw two boats coming down stream at a racing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.791#speed, exchanging volleys of insults, in which the repeated cries of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.792#“Sawbones!” and “Counter-jumpers!” dominated.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.793#“Hallo!” said Pauline, “it's Monsieur Hutin.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.794#“Yes,” said Baugé, shading his face with his hand, “I recognise his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.795#mahogany boat. The other one is manned by students, no doubt.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.796#And he explained the deadly hatred existing between the young students
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.797#and the shopmen. Denise, on hearing Hutin's name mentioned, suddenly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.798#stopped, and followed, with fixed eyes, the frail skiff spinning along
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.799#like an arrow. She tried to distinguish the young man among the rowers,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.800#but could only manage to make out the white dresses of two women, one of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.801#whom, who was steering, wore a red hat. Their voices were drowned by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.802#rapid flow of the river.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.803#“Pitch 'em in, the sawbones!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.804#“Duck 'em, the counter-jumpers!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.805#In the evening they returned to the restaurant on the island. But it had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.806#turned too chilly, they were obliged to dine in one of the closed rooms,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.807#where the table-cloths were still damp from the humidity of the winter.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.808#After six o'clock the tables were all occupied, yet the excursionists
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.809#still hurried in, looking for a corner; and the waiters continued to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.810#bring in more chairs and forms, putting the plates closer together, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.811#crowding the people up. It was stifling, they had to open the windows.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.812#Outdoors, the day was waning, a greenish twilight fell from the poplars
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.813#so quickly that the proprietor, unprepared for these meals under cover,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.814#and having no lamps, was obliged to put a wax candle on each table. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.815#uproar became deafening with laughing, calling out, and the clacking of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.816#the table utensils; the candles flared and melted in the draught from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.817#the windows, whilst moths fluttered about in the air, warmed by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.818#odour of the food, and traversed by sudden gusts of cold wind.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.819#“What fun they're having, eh?” said Pauline, very busy with a plate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.820#of matelote, which she declared extraordinary. She leant over to add:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.821#“Didn't you see Monsieur Albert over there?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.822#It was really young Lhomme, in the middle of three questionable women,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.823#a vulgar-looking old lady in a yellow bonnet, suspiciously like a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.824#procuress, and two young girls of thirteen or fourteen, forward and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.825#painfully impudent creatures. He, already intoxicated, was knocking his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.826#glass on the table, and talking of drubbing the waiter if he did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.827#bring some “liqueurs” immediately.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.828#“Well!” resumed Pauline, “there's a family, if you like! the mother at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.829#Rambouillet, the father in Paris; and the son at Joinville; they won't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.830#tread on one another's toes!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.831#Denise, who detested noise, smiled, however, and tasted the joy of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.832#ceasing to think, amid such uproar. But all at once they heard a noise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.833#in the other room, a burst of voices which drowned the others. They
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.834#were yelling, and must have come to blows, for one could hear a scuffle,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.835#chairs falling down, quite a struggle, amid which the river-cries again
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.836#resounded:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.837#“Duck 'em, the counter-jumpers!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.838#“Pitch 'em in, the sawbones!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.839#And when the hotel-keeper's loud voice had calmed this tempest, Hutin
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.840#suddenly made his appearance, wearing a red jersey, and a little cap
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.841#at the back of his head; he had on his arm the tall, fair girl, who had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.842#been steering, and who, in order to wear the boat's colours, had planted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.843#a bunch of poppies behind her ear. They were greeted on entering by a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.844#storm of applause; and his face beamed with pride, he swelled out his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.845#chest, assuming a nautical rolling gait, showing off a blow which had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.846#blackened his cheek, puffed up with joy at being noticed. Behind them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.847#followed the crew. They took a table by storm, and the uproar became
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.848#something fearful.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.849#“It appears,” explained Bauge, after having listened to the conversation
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.850#behind him, “it appears that the students have recognised the woman
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.851#with Hutin as an old friend from their neighbourhood, who now sings in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.852#a music-hall at Montmartre. So they were kicking up a row for her. These
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.853#students never pay their women.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.854#“In any case,” said Pauline, stiffly, “she's jolly ugly, with her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.855#carroty hair. Really, I don't know where Monsieur Hutin picks them up,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.856#but they're an ugly, dirty lot.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.857#Denise had turned pale, and felt an icy coldness, as if her heart's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.858#blood were flowing away, drop by drop. She had already, on seeing the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.859#boats from the bank, felt a shiver; but now she no longer had any doubt,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.860#this girl was certainly with Hutin. With trembling hands, and a choking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.861#sensation in her throat, she ceased eating.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.862#“What's the matter?” asked her friend.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.863#“Nothing,” stammered she; “it's rather warm here.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.864#But Hutin's table was close to theirs, and when he perceived Bauge,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.865#whom he knew, he commenced a conversation in a shrill voice, in order to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.866#attract further attention.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.867#“I say,” cried he, “are you as virtuous as ever at the Bon Marche?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.868#“Not so much as all that,” replied Bauge, turning very red.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.869#“That won't do! You know they only take virgins there, and there's a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.870#confessional box permanently fixed for the salesmen who venture to look
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.871#at them. A house where they marry you--no, thanks!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.872#The other fellows began to laugh. Liénard, who belonged to the crew,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.873#added: “It isn't like the Louvre. There they have a midwife attached to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.874#the ready-made department. My word of honour!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.875#The gaiety increased; Pauline herself burst out, the idea of the midwife
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.876#seemed so funny. But Baugé was annoyed by the jokes about the innocence
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.877#of his house. He launched out all at once: “Oh, you're not too well off
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.878#at The Ladies' Paradise. Sacked for the slightest thing! And a governor
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.879#who seems to tout for his lady customers.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.880#Hutin no longer listened to him, but commenced to praise the house in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.881#the Place Clichÿ. He knew a young girl there so excessively aristocratic
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.882#that the customers dared not speak to her for fear of humiliating her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.883#Then, drawing up closer, he related that he had made a hundred and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.884#fifteen francs that week; oh! a capital week. Favier left behind with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.885#fifty-two francs, the whole lot floored. And it was visible he was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.886#bursting with money, he would not go to bed till he had liquidated the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.887#hundred and fifteen francs. Then, as he gradually became intoxicated,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.888#he attacked Robineau, that fool of a second-hand who affected to keep
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.889#himself apart, going so far as to refuse to walk in the street with one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.890#of his salesmen.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.891#“Shut up,” said Liénard; “you talk too much, old man.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.892#The heat had increased, the candles were guttering down on to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.893#table-cloths stained with wine; and through the open windows, when the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.894#noise within ceased for an instant, there entered a distant prolonged
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.895#voice, the voice of the river, and of the tall poplars sleeping in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.896#calm night. Baugé had just called for the bill, seeing that Denise was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.897#now quite white, her throat choked by the tears she withheld; but the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.898#waiter did not appear, and she had to submit to Hutin's loud talk. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.899#was now boasting of being more superior to Liénard, because Liénard
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.900#cared for nothing, simply squandering his father's money, whilst he,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.901#Hutin, was spending his own earnings, the fruit of his intelligence. At
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.902#last Baugé paid, and the two girls went out.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.903#“There's one from the Louvre,” murmured Pauline in the outer room,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.904#looking at a tall thin girl putting on her mantle.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.905#“You don't know her. You can't tell,” said the young man.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.906#“Oh, can't I? They've got a way of draping themselves. She belongs to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.907#the midwife's department! If she heard, she must be pleased.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.908#They got outside at last, and Denise heaved a sigh of relief. For a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.909#moment she had thought she was going to die in that suffocating heat,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.910#amidst all those cries; and she still attributed her faintness to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.911#want of air. Now she breathed freely in the freshness of the starry
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.912#night As the two young girls were leaving the garden of the restaurant,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.913#a timid voice murmured in the shade: “Good evening, ladies.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.914#It was Deloche. They had not seen him at the further end of the front
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.915#room, where he was dining alone, after having come from Paris on foot,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.916#for the pleasure of the walk. On recognising this friendly voice,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.917#Denise, suffering, yielded mechanically to the want of some support.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.918#“Monsieur Deloche, come back with us,” said she. “Give me your arm.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.919#Pauline and Baugé had already gone on in front. They were astonished,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.920#never thinking it would turn out like this, and with this fellow above
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.921#all. However, as there was still an hour before the train started,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.922#they went to the end of the island, following the bank, under the tall
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.923#poplars; and, from time to time, they turned round, murmuring: “But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.924#where are they? Ah, there they are. It's rather funny, all the same.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.925#At first Denise and Deloche remained silent The noise from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.926#restaurant was slowly dying away, changing into a musical sweetness in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.927#the calmness of the night; and they went further in amongst the cool of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.928#the trees, still feverish from that furnace, the lights of which were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.929#disappearing one by one behind the foliage. Opposite them there was a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.930#sort of shadowy wall, a mass of shade in which the trunks and branches
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.931#buried themselves so compact that they could not even distinguish any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.932#trace of the path. However, they went forward quietly, without fear.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.933#Then, their eyes getting more accustomed to the darkness, they saw on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.934#the right the trunks of the poplars, resembling sombre columns upholding
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.935#the domes of their branches, pierced with stars; whilst on the right the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.936#water assumed occasionally in the darkness the brightness of a mirror.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.937#The wind was subsiding, they no longer heard anything but the flowing of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.938#the river.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.939#“I am very pleased to have met you,” stammered Deloche at last, making
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.940#up his mind to speak first. “You can't think how happy you render me in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.941#consenting to walk with me.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.942#And, aided by the darkness, after many awkward attempts, he ventured to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.943#tell her he loved her. He had long wanted to write to her and tell her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.944#so; and perhaps she would never have known it had it not been for this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.945#lovely night coming to his assistance, this water that murmured so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.946#softly, and these trees which screened them with their shade. But she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.947#did not reply; she continued to walk by his side with the same suffering
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.948#air. And he was trying to look into her face, when he heard a sob.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.949#“Oh! good heavens!” he exclaimed, “you are crying, mademoiselle, you are
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.950#crying! Have I offended you?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.951#“No, no,” she murmured.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.952#She tried to keep back her tears, but she could not. Even when at table,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.953#she had thought her heart was about to burst. She abandoned herself in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.954#the darkness entirely, stifled by her sobs, thinking that if Hutin had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.955#been in Deloche's place and said such tender things to her, she would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.956#have been unable to resist. This confession made to herself filled her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.957#with confusion. A feeling of shame burnt her face, as if she had already
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.958#fallen into the arms of that Hutin, who was disporting himself with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.959#those girls.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.960#“I didn't mean to offend you,” continued Deloche, almost crying also.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.961#“No, but listen,” said she, her voice still trembling; “I am not at all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.962#angry with you. But never speak to me again as you have just done. What
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.963#you ask is impossible. Oh! you're a good fellow, and I'm quite willing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.964#to be your friend, but nothing more. You understand--your friend.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.965#He shuddered. After a few steps taken in silence, he stammered: “In
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.966#fact, you don't love me?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.967#And as she spared him the pain of a brutal “no,” he resumed in a soft,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.968#heart-broken voice: “Oh, I was prepared for it I have never had any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.969#luck, I know I can never be happy. At home, they used to beat me. In
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.970#Paris, I've always been a drudge. You see, when one does not know how
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.971#to rob other fellows of their mistresses, and when one is too awkward to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.972#earn as much as the others, why the best thing is to go into some corner
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.973#and die. Never fear, I sha'n't torment you any more. As for loving you,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.974#you can't prevent me, can you? I shall love you for nothing, like a dog.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.975#There, everything escapes me, that's my luck in life.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.976#And he, too, burst into tears. She tried to console him, and in their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.977#friendly effusion they found they belonged to the same department--she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.978#to Valognes, he to Briquebec, eight miles from each other, and this was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.979#a fresh tie. His father, a poor, needy bailiff, and sickly jealous, used
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.980#to drub him, calling him a bastard, exasperated with his long pale face
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.981#and tow-like hair, which, said he, did not belong to the family. And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.982#they got talking about the vast pastures, surrounded with quick-set
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.983#hedges, of the shady paths winding beneath the elm trees, and of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.984#grass grown roads, like the alleys in a park.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.985#Around them night was getting darker, but they could still distinguish
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.986#the rushes on the banks, and the interlaced foliage, black beneath the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.987#twinkling stars; and a peacefulness came over them, they forgot their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.988#troubles, brought nearer by their ill-luck, in a closer feeling of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.989#friendship.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.990#“Well?” asked Pauline of Denise, taking her aside when they arrived at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.991#the station.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.992#The young girl understood by the smile and the stare of tender
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.993#curiosity; she turned very red and replied: “But--never, my dear! I told
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.994#you I did not wish to! He belongs to my part of the country. We were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.995#talking about Valognes.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.996#Pauline and Bauge were perplexed, put out in their ideas, not knowing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.997#what to think. Deloche left them in the Place de la Bastille; like all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.998#young probationers, he slept at the house, where he had to be in by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.999#eleven o'clock. Not wishing to go in with him, Denise, who had got
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1000#permission to go to the theatre, accepted Baugé's invitation to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1001#accompany Pauline to his home--he, in order to be nearer his mistress,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1002#had moved into the Rue Saint-Roch. They took a cab, and Denise was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1003#stupefied on learning on the way that her friend was going to stay all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1004#night with the young man--nothing was easier, they only had to give
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1005#Madame Cabin five francs, all the young ladies did it. Bauge did the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1006#honours of his room, which was furnished with old Empire furniture,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1007#given him by his father. He got angry when Denise spoke of settling up,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1008#but at last accepted the fifteen francs twelve sous which she had laid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1009#on the chest of drawers; but he insisted on making her a cup of tea, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1010#he struggled with a spirit-lamp and saucepan, and then was obliged to go
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1011#and fetch some sugar. Midnight struck as he was pouring out the tea.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1012#“I must be off,” said Denise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1013#“Presently,” replied Pauline. “The theatres don't close so early.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1014#Denise felt uncomfortable in this bachelor's room. She had seen her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1015#friend take off her things, turn down the bed, open it, and pat the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1016#pillows with her naked arms; and these preparations for a night of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1017#love-making carried on before her, troubled her, and made her feel
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1018#ashamed, awakening once in her wounded heart the recollection of Hutin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1019#Such ideas were not very salutary. At last she left them, at a quarter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1020#past twelve. But she went away confused, when in reply to her innocent
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1021#“good night,” Pauline cried out, thoughtlessly; “Thanks, we are sure to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1022#have a good one!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1023#The private door leading to Mouret's apartments and to the employees'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1024#bedrooms was in the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin. Madame Cabin opened the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1025#door and gave a glance in order to mark the return. A night-light
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1026#was burning dimly in the hall, and Denise, finding herself in this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1027#uncertain light, hesitated, and was seized with fear, for on turning the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1028#corner of the street, she had seen the door close on the vague shadow of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1029#a man. It must have been the governor coming home from a party,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1030#and the idea that he was there in the dark waiting for her perhaps,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1031#caused her one of those strange fears with which he still inspired her,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1032#without any reasonable cause. Some one moved on the first-floor, a boot
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1033#creaked, and losing her head entirely, she pushed open a door which led
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1034#into the shop, and which was always left open for the night-watch. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1035#was in the printed cotton department.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1036#“Good heavens! what shall I do?” she stammered, in her emotion.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1037#The idea occurred to her that there was another door upstairs leading
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1038#to the bedrooms; but she would have to go right across the shop. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1039#preferred this, notwithstanding the darkness reigning in the galleries.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1040#Not a gas-jet was burning, there were only a few oil-lamps hung here and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1041#there on the branches of the lustres; and these scattered lights, like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1042#yellow patches, their rays lost in the gloom, resembled the lanterns
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1043#hung up in a mine. Big shadows loomed in the air; one could hardly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1044#distinguish the piles of goods, which assumed alarming profiles: fallen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1045#columns, squatting beasts, and lurking thieves. The heavy silence,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1046#broken by distant respirations, increased still more the darkness.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1047#However, she saw where she was. The linen department on her left formed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1048#a dead colour, like the blueiness of houses in the street under a summer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1049#sky; then she wished to cross the hall immediately, but running up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1050#against some piles of printed calico, she thought it safer to follow the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1051#hosiery department, and then the woollen one. There she was frightened
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1052#by a loud noise of snoring. It was Joseph, the messenger, sleeping
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1053#behind some articles of mourning. She quickly ran into the hall, now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1054#illuminated by the skylight, with a sort of crepuscular light which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1055#made it appear larger, full of a nocturnal church-like terror, with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1056#immobility of its shelves, and the shadows of its yard-measures which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1057#described reversed crosses. She now fairly ran away. In the mercery and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1058#glove departments she nearly walked over some more messengers, and only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1059#felt safe when she at last found herself on the staircase. But upstairs,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1060#before the ready-made department, she was seized with fear on perceiving
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1061#a lantern moving forward, twinkling in the darkness. It was the watch,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1062#two firemen marking their passage on the faces of the indicators. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1063#stood a moment unable to understand it, watched them passing from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1064#the shawl to the furniture department, then to the under-linen,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1065#terrified by their strange manouvres, by the grinding of the key, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1066#by the closing of the iron doors which made a murderous noise. When they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1067#approached, she took refuge in the lace department, but a sound of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1068#talking made her hastily depart, and run off to the outer door. She had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1069#recognised Deloche's voice. He slept in his department, on a little iron
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1070#bedstead which he set up himself every evening; and he was not asleep
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1071#yet, recalling the pleasant hours he had just spent.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1072#“What! it's you, mademoiselle?” said Mouret, whom Denise found before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1073#her on the staircase, a small pocket-candlestick in his hand.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1074#She stammered, and tried to explain that she had come to look for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1075#something. But he was not angry. He looked at her with his paternal, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1076#at the same time curious, air.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1077#“You had permission to go to the theatre, then?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1078#“Yes, sir.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1079#“And have you enjoyed yourself? What theatre did you go to?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1080#“I have been in the country, sir.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1081#That made him laugh. Then he asked, laying a certain stress on his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1082#question: “All alone?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1083#“No, sir; with a lady friend,” replied she, her cheeks burning, shocked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1084#at the idea which he no doubt entertained.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1085#He said no more; but he was still looking at her in her simple black
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1086#dress and hat trimmed with a single blue ribbon. Was this little savage
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1087#going to turn out a pretty girl? She looked all the better for her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1088#day in the open air, charming with her splendid hair falling over her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1089#forehead. And he, who during the last six months had treated her like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1090#a child, some times giving her advice, yielding to a desire to gain
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1091#experience, to a wicked wish to know how a woman sprung up and lost
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1092#herself in Paris, no longer laughed, experiencing a feeling of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1093#surprise and fear mingled with tenderness. No doubt it was a lover who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1094#embellished her like this. At this thought he felt as if stung to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1095#quick by a favourite bird, with which he was playing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1096#“Good night, sir,” murmured Denise, continuing her way without waiting.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1097#He did not answer, but stood watching her till she dis appeared. Then he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:v.1098#entered his own apartments.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.1#CHAPTER VI.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.2#When the dead summer season arrived, there was quite a panic at The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.3#Ladies' Paradise. The reign of terror commenced, a great many employees
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.4#were sent away on leave, and others were dismissed in dozens by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.5#principals, who wished to clear the shop, no customers appearing during
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.6#the July and August heat. Mouret, on making his daily inspection with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.7#Burdoncle, called aside the managers, whom he had prompted during the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.8#winter to engage more men than were necessary, so that the business
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.9#should not suffer, leaving them to weed out their staff later on. It was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.10#now a question of reducing expenses by getting rid of quite a third of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.11#the shop people, the weak ones who allowed themselves to be swallowed up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.12#by the strong ones.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.13#“Come,” he would say, “you must have some who don't suit you. We can't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.14#keep them all this time doing nothing.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.15#And if the manager hesitated, hardly knowing whom to sacrifice, he would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.16#continue; “Make your arrangements, six salesmen must suffice; you can
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.17#take on others in October, there are plenty to be had!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.18#As a rule Bourdoncle undertook the executions. He had a terrible way of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.19#saying: “Go and be paid!” which fell like a blow from an axe. Anything
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.20#served him as a pretext for clearing off the superfluous staff. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.21#invented misdeeds, speculating on the slightest negligence. “You were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.22#sitting down, sir; go and be paid!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.23#“You dare to answer me; go and be paid!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.24#“Your shoes are not clean; go and be paid!” And even the bravest
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.25#trembled in presence of the massacre which he left behind him. Then,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.26#this system not working quick enough, he invented a trap by which he got
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.27#rid in a few days, without fatigue, of the number of salesmen condemned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.28#beforehand. At eight o'clock, he took his stand at the door, watch in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.29#hand; and at three minutes past the hour, the breathless young people
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.30#were greeted with the implacable “Go and be paid!” This was a quick and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.31#cleanly method of doing the work.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.32#“You've an ugly mug,” he ended by saying one day to a poor wretch whose
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.33#nose, all on one side, annoyed him, “go and be paid!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.34#The favoured ones obtained a fortnight's holiday without pay, which was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.35#a more humane way of lessening the expenses. The salesmen accepted their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.36#precarious situation, obliged to do so by necessity and habit. Since
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.37#their arrival in Paris, they had roamed about, commencing their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.38#apprenticeship here, finishing it there, getting dismissed or themselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.39#resigning all at once, as interest dictated. When business stood still,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.40#the workmen were deprived of their daily bread; and this was well
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.41#understood in the indifferent march of the machine, the useless
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.42#workmen were quietly thrown aside, like so much old plant, there was no
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.43#gratitude shown for services rendered. So much the worse for those who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.44#did not know how to look after themselves!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.45#Nothing else was now talked of in the various departments. Fresh stories
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.46#circulated every day. The dismissed salesmen were named, as one counts
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.47#the dead in time of cholera. The shawl and the woollen departments
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.48#suffered especially; seven employees disappeared from them in one week.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.49#Then the underlinen department was thrown into confusion, a customer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.50#had nearly fainted away, accusing the young person who had served her of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.51#eating garlic; and the latter was dismissed at once, although, badly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.52#fed and dying of hunger, she was simply finishing a collection of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.53#bread crusts at the counter. The authorities were pitiless at the least
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.54#complaint from the customers; no excuse was admitted, the employee was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.55#always wrong, and had to disappear like a defective instrument, hurtful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.56#to the proper working of the business; and the others bowed their heads,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.57#not even attempting any defence. In the panic which was raging each one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.58#trembled for himself. Mignot, going out one day with a parcel under his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.59#coat, notwithstanding the rules, was nearly caught, and really thought
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.60#himself lost. Liénard, who was celebrated for his idleness, owed to his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.61#father's position in the drapery trade that he was not turned away one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.62#afternoon that Bourdoncle found him dozing between two piles of English
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.63#velvets. But the Lhommes were especially anxious, expecting every day
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.64#to see their son Albert sent away, the governor being very dissatisfied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.65#with his conduct at the pay-desk. He frequently had women there who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.66#distracted his attention from his work; and twice Madame Aurélie had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.67#been obliged to plead for him with the principals.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.68#Denise was so menaced amid this general clearance, that she lived in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.69#constant expectation of a catastrophe. It was in vain that she summoned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.70#up her courage, struggling with all her gaiety and all her reason not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.71#to yield to the misgivings of her tender nature; she burst out into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.72#blinding tears as soon as she had closed the door of her bedroom,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.73#desolated at the thought of seeing herself in the street, on bad terms
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.74#with her uncle, not knowing where to go, without a sou saved, and having
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.75#the two children to look after. The sensations she had felt the first
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.76#few weeks sprang up again, she fancied herself a grain of seed under
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.77#a powerful millstone; and, utterly discouraged, she abandoned herself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.78#entirely to the thought of what a small atom she was in this great
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.79#machine, which would certainly crush her with its quiet indifference.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.80#There was no illusion possible; if they sent away any one from her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.81#department she knew it would be her. No doubt, during the Rambouillet
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.82#excursion, the other young ladies had incensed Madame Aurélie against
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.83#her, for since then that lady had treated her with an air of severity in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.84#which there was a certain rancour. Besides, they could not forgive her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.85#going to Joinville, regarding it as a sign of revolt, a means of setting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.86#the whole department at defiance, by parading about with a young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.87#lady from a rival counter. Never had Denise suffered so much in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.88#department, and she now gave up all hope of conquering it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.89#“Let them alone!” repeated Pauline, “a lot of stuck-up things, as stupid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.90#as donkeys!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.91#But it was just these fine lady airs which intimidated Denise. Nearly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.92#all the saleswomen, by their daily contact with the rich customers,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.93#assumed certain graces, and finished by forming a vague nameless class,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.94#something between a work-girl and a middle-class lady. But beneath their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.95#art in dress, and the manners and phrases learnt by heart, there was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.96#often only a false superficial education, the fruits of attending cheap
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.97#theatres and music-halls, and picking up all the current stupidities of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.98#the Paris pavement.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.99#“You know the 'unkempt girl' has got a child?” said Clara one morning,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.100#on arriving in the department. And, as they seemed astonished, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.101#continued: “I saw her yesterday myself taking the child out for a walk!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.102#She's got it stowed away in the neighbourhood, somewhere.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.103#Two days after, Margueritte came up after dinner with another piece
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.104#of news. “A nice thing, I've just seen the 'unkempt girl's' lover--a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.105#workman, just fancy! Yes, a dirty little workman, with yellow hair, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.106#was watching her through the windows.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.107#From that moment it was an accepted truth: Denise had a workman for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.108#a lover, and an infant concealed somewhere in the neighbourhood. They
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.109#overwhelmed her with spiteful allusions. The first time she understood
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.110#she turned quite pale before the monstrosity of their suppositions. It
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.111#was abominable; she tried to explain, and stammered out: “But they are
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.112#my brothers!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.113#“Oh! oh! her brothers!” said Clara in a bantering tone.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.114#Madame Aurélie was obliged to interfere. “Be quiet! young ladies. You
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.115#had better go on changing those tickets. Mademoiselle Baudu is quite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.116#free to misbehave herself out of doors, if only she worked a bit when
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.117#here.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.118#This curt defence was a condemnation. The young girl, feeling choked as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.119#if they had accused her of a crime, vainly endeavoured to explain the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.120#facts. They laughed and shrugged their shoulders, and she felt wounded
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.121#to the heart On hearing the rumour, Deloche was so indignant that he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.122#wanted to slap the faces of the young ladies in Denise's department; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.123#was only restrained by the fear of compromising her. Since the evening
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.124#at Joinville, he entertained a submissive love, an almost religious
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.125#friendship for her, which he proved by his faithful doglike looks. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.126#was careful not to show his affection before the others, for they would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.127#have laughed at them; but that did not prevent his dreaming of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.128#avenging blow, if ever any one should attack her before him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.129#Denise finished by not answering the insults. It was too odious, nobody
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.130#would believe it. When any girl ventured a fresh allusion, she contented
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.131#herself with looking at her with a sad, calm air. Besides, she had other
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.132#troubles, material anxieties which took up her attention. Jean went on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.133#as bad as ever, always worrying her for money. Hardly a week passed that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.134#she did not receive some fresh story from him, four pages long; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.135#when the house postman brought her these letters, in a big, passionate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.136#handwriting, she hastened to hide them in her pocket, for the saleswomen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.137#affected to laugh, and sung snatches of some doubtful ditties.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.138#Then after having invented a pretext to go to the other end of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.139#establishment and read the letters, she was seized with fear; poor Jean
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.140#seemed to be lost. All his fibs went down with her, she believed all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.141#his extraordinary love adventures, her complete ignorance of such things
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.142#making her exaggerate the danger. Sometimes it was a two-franc piece
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.143#to enable him to escape the jealousy of some woman; at other times five
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.144#francs, six francs, to get some poor girl out of a scrape, whose father
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.145#would otherwise kill her. So that as her salary and commission did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.146#suffice, she had conceived the idea of looking for a little work after
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.147#business hours. She spoke about it to Robineau, who had shown a certain
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.148#sympathy for her since their meeting at Vinçard's, and he had procured
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.149#her the making of some neckties at five sous a dozen. At night, between
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.150#nine and one o'clock, she could do six dozen, which made thirty sous,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.151#out of which she had to deduct four sous for a candle. But as this sum
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.152#kept Jean going she did not complain of the want of sleep, and would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.153#have thought herself very happy had not another catastrophe once more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.154#overthrown her budget calculations. At the end of the second fortnight,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.155#when she went to the necktie-dealer, she found the door closed; the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.156#woman had failed, become bankrupt, thus carrying off her eighteen francs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.157#six sous, a considerable sum on which she had been counting for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.158#last week. All the annoyances in the department disappeared before this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.159#disaster.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.160#“You look dull,” said Pauline, meeting her in the furniture gallery,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.161#looking very pale. “Are you in want of anything?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.162#But as Denise already owed her friend twelve francs, she tried to smile
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.163#and replied: “No, thanks. I've not slept well, that's all.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.164#It was the twentieth of July, when the panic caused by the dismissals
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.165#was at its worst. Out of the four hundred employees, Bourdoncle had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.166#already sacked fifty, and there were rumours of fresh executions. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.167#thought but little of the menaces which were flying about, entirely
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.168#taken up by the anguish of one of Jean's adventures, still more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.169#terrifying than the others. This very day he wanted fifteen francs,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.170#which sum alone could save him from the vengeance of an outraged
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.171#husband. The previous evening she had received the first letter opening
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.172#the drama; then, one after the other, came two more; in the last, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.173#she was finishing when Pauline met her, Jean announced his death
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.174#for that evening, if she did not send the money. She was in agony.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.175#Impossible to take it out of Pépé's board, paid two days before. Every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.176#sort of bad luck was pursuing her, for she had hoped to get her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.177#eighteen francs six sous through Robineau, who could perhaps find the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.178#necktie-dealer; but Robineau having got a fortnight's holiday, had not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.179#returned the previous night as he was expected to do.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.180#However, Pauline still questioned her in a friendly way; when they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.181#met, in an out-of-the-way department, they conversed for a few minutes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.182#keeping a sharp look-out the while. Suddenly, Pauline made a move as if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.183#to run off, having observed the white tie of an inspector who was coming
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.184#out of the shawl department.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.185#“Ah! it's only old Jouve!” murmured she in a relieved tone. “I can't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.186#think what makes the old man grin as he does when he sees us together.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.187#In your place I should beware, for he's too kind to you. He's an old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.188#humbug, as spiteful as a cat, and thinks he's still got his troopers to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.189#talk to.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.190#It was quite true; Jouve was detested by all the salespeople for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.191#severity of his treatment More than half the dismissals were the result
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.192#of his reports; and with his big red nose of a rakish ex-captain, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.193#only exercised his leniency in the departments served by women.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.194#“Why should I be afraid?” asked Denise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.195#“Well!” replied Pauline, laughing, “perhaps he may exact some return.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.196#Several of the young ladies try to keep well with him.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.197#Jouve had gone away, pretending not to see them; and they heard him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.198#dropping on to a salesman in the lace department, guilty of watching a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.199#fallen horse in the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.200#“By the way,” resumed Pauline, “weren't you looking for Monsieur
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.201#Robineau yesterday? He's come back.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.202#Denise thought she was saved. “Thanks, I'll go round the other way then,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.203#and pass through the silk department. So much the worse! They sent me
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.204#upstairs to the work-room to fetch a bodkin.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.205#And they separated. The young girl, with a busy look, as if she were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.206#running from pay-desk to pay-desk in search of something, arrived on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.207#stairs and went down into the hall. It was a quarter to ten, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.208#first lunch-bell had rung. A warm sun was playing on the windows, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.209#notwithstanding the grey linen blinds, the heat penetrated into the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.210#stagnant air. Now and then a refreshing breath arose from the floor,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.211#which the messengers were gently watering. It was a somnolence, a summer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.212#siesta, in the midst of the empty space around the counters, like the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.213#interior of a church wrapt in sleeping shadow after the last mass.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.214#Some listless salesmen were standing about, a few rare customers were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.215#crossing the galleries and the hall, with the fatigued step of women
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.216#annoyed by the sun.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.217#Just as Denise went down, Favier was measuring a dress length of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.218#light silk, with pink spots, for Madame Boutarel, arrived in Paris the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.219#previous day from the South. Since the commencement of the month, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.220#provinces had been sending up their detachments; one saw nothing but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.221#queerly-dressed ladies with yellow shawls, green skirts, and flaring
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.222#bonnets. The shopmen, indifferent, were too indolent to laugh at them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.223#even. Favier accompanied Madame Boutarel to the mercery department, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.224#on returning, said to Hutin:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.225#“Yesterday they were all Auvergnat women, to-day they're all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.226#Provençales. I'm sick of them.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.227#But Hutin rushed forward, it was his turn, and he had recognised “the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.228#pretty lady,” the lovely blonde whom the department thus designated,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.229#knowing nothing about her, not even her name. They all smiled at her,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.230#not a week passed without her coming to The Ladies' Paradise, always
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.231#alone. This time she had a little boy of four or five with her, and this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.232#gave rise to some comment.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.233#“She's married, then?” asked Favier, when Hutin returned from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.234#pay-desk, where he had debited her with thirty yards of Duchess satin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.235#“Possibly,” replied he, “although the youngster proves nothing. Perhaps
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.236#he belongs to a lady friend. What's certain is, that she must have been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.237#weeping. She's so melancholy, and her eyes are so red!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.238#À silence ensued. The two salesmen gazed vaguely into the depths of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.239#shop. Then Favier resumed in a low voice; “If she's married, perhaps her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.240#husband's given her a drubbing.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.241#“Possibly,” repeated Hutin, “unless it be a lover who has left her.” And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.242#after a fresh silence, he added: “Any way, I don't care a hang!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.243#At this moment Denise crossed the silk department, slackening her pace
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.244#and looking around her, trying to find Robineau. She could not see him,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.245#so she went into the linen department, then passed through again. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.246#two salesmen had noticed her movements.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.247#“There's that bag of bones again,” murmured Hutin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.248#“She's looking for Robineau,” said Favier. “I can't think what they're
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.249#up to together. Oh! nothing smutty; Robineau's too big a fool. They say
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.250#he has procured her a little work, some neckties. What a spec, eh?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.251#Hutin was meditating something spiteful. When Denise passed near he, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.252#stopped her, saying: “Is it me you're looking for?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.253#She turned very red. Since the Joinville excursion, she dared not read
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.254#her heart, full of confused sensations. She was constantly recalling his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.255#appearance with that red-haired girl, and if she still trembled before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.256#him, it was doubtless from uneasiness. Had she ever loved him? Did she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.257#love him still? She hardly liked to stir up these things, which were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.258#painful to her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.259#“No, sir,” she replied, embarrassed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.260#Hutin then began to laugh at her uneasy manner. “Would you like us to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.261#serve him to you? Favier, just serve this young lady with Robineau.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.262#She looked at him fixedly, with the sad calm look with which she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.263#received the wounding remarks the young ladies had made about her. Ah!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.264#he was spiteful, he attacked her as well as the others! And she felt a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.265#sort of supreme anguish, the breaking of a last tie. Her face expressed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.266#such real suffering, that Favier, though not of a very tender nature,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.267#came to her assistance.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.268#“Monsieur Robineau is in the stock-room,” said he. “No doubt he will
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.269#be back for lunch. You'll find him here this afternoon, if you want to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.270#speak to him.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.271#Denise thanked him, and went up to her department, where Madamé Aurélie
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.272#was waiting for her in a terrible rage. What! she had been gone half an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.273#hour! Where had she just sprung from? Not from the work-room, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.274#was quite certain! The poor girl hung down her head, thinking of this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.275#avalanche of misfortunes. All would be over if Robineau did not come in.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.276#However, she resolved to go down again.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.277#In the silk department, Robineau's return had provoked quite a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.278#revolution. The salesmen had hoped that, disgusted with the annoyances
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.279#they were incessantly causing him, he would not return; and, in fact,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.280#there was a moment, when pressed by Vinçard to take over his business,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.281#he had almost decided to do so. Hutin's secret working, the mine he had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.282#been laying under the second-hand's feet for months past, was about to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.283#be sprung. During Robineau's holidays, Hutin, who had taken his place
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.284#as second-hand, had done his best to injure him in the minds of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.285#principals, and get possession of his situation by an excess of zeal; he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.286#discovered and reported all sorts of trifling irregularities, suggested
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.287#improvements, and invented new designs. In fact, every one in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.288#department, from the unpaid probationer, longing to become a salesman,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.289#up to the first salesman who coveted the situation of manager, they all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.290#had one fixed idea, and that was to dislodge the comrade above them, to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.291#ascend another rung of the ladder, swallowing him up if necessary; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.292#this struggle of appetites, this pushing the one against the other, even
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.293#contributed to the better working of the machine, provoking business
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.294#and increasing tenfold the success which was astonishing Paris. Behind
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.295#Hutin, there was Favier; then behind Favier came the others, in a long
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.296#line. One heard a loud noise as of jaw-bones working. Robineau was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.297#condemned, each one was grabbing after his bone. So that when the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.298#second-hand reappeared there was a general grumbling. The matter had to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.299#be settled, the salesmen's attitude appeared so menacing, that the head
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.300#of the department had sent Robineau to the stock-room, in order to give
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.301#the authorities time to come to a decision.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.302#“We would sooner all leave, if they keep him,” declared Hutin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.303#This affair bothered Bouthemont, whose gaiety ill-accorded with such
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.304#an internal vexation. He was pained to see nothing but scowling faces
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.305#around him. However, he wished to be just “Come, leave him alone, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.306#doesn't hurt you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.307#But they protested energetically. “What! doesn't hurt us! An
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.308#insupportable object, always irritable, capable of walking over your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.309#body, he's so proud!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.310#This was the great bitterness of the department Robineau, nervous as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.311#a woman, was intolerably stiff and susceptible. They related scores of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.312#stories, a poor little fellow who had fallen ill through it, and lady
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.313#customers even who had been humiliated by his nasty remarks.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.314#“Well, gentlemen, I won't take anything on myself,” said Bouthemont.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.315#“I've notified the directors, and am going to speak about it shortly.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.316#The second lunch-bell rang, the clang of which came up from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.317#basement, distant and deadened in the close air of the shop. Hutin and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.318#Favier went down. From all the counters, the salesmen were arriving one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.319#by one, helter-skelter, hastening below to the narrow entrance to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.320#kitchen, a damp passage always lighted with gas. The throng pushed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.321#forward, without a laugh or a word, amidst an increasing noise of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.322#crockery and a strong odour of food. At the extremity of the passage
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.323#there was a sudden halt, before a wicket. Flanked with piles of plates,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.324#armed with forks and spoons, which he was plunging in the copper-pans, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.325#cook was distributing the portions. And when he stood aside, the flaring
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.326#kitchen could be seen behind his white-covered belly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.327#“Of course!” muttered Hutin, consulting the bill of fare, written on a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.328#black-board above the wicket. “Beef and pungent sauce, or skate. Never
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.329#any roast meat in this rotten shop! Their boiled beef and fish don't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.330#do a bit of good to a fellow!” Moreover, the fish was universally
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.331#neglected, for the pan was quite full. Favier, however, took some skate.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.332#Behind him, Hutin stooped down, saying: “Beef and pungent sauce.” With
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.333#a mechanical movement, the cook picked up a piece of meat, and poured
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.334#a spoonful of sauce over it; and Hutin, suffocated by the ardent breath
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.335#from the kitchen, had hardly got his portion, before the words, “Beef,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.336#pungent sauce; beef, pungent sauce,” followed each other like a litany;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.337#whilst the cook continued to pick up the meat and pour over the sauce,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.338#with the rapid and rhythmical movement of a well-regulated clock.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.339#“But the skate's cold,” declared Favier, whose hand felt no warmth from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.340#the plate.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.341#They were all hurrying along now, with their plates held out straight,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.342#for fear of running up against one another. Ten steps further was the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.343#bar, another wicket with a shiny zinc counter, on which were ranged the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.344#shares of wine, small bottles, without corks, still damp from rinsing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.345#And each took one of these bottles in his empty hand as he passed, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.346#then, completely laden, made for his table with a serious air, careful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.347#not to spill anything.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.348#Hutin grumbled, “This is a fine dance, with all this crockery!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.349#Their table, Favier's and his, was at the end of the corridor in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.350#last dining-room. The rooms were all alike, old cellars twelve feet by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.351#fifteen, which had been cemented over and fitted up as refectories; but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.352#the damp came through the paint-work, the yellow walls were covered with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.353#greenish spots; and, from the narrow air-holes, opening on the street,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.354#on a level with the pavement, there fell a livid light, incessantly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.355#traversed by the vague shadows of the passers-by. In July as in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.356#December, one was stifled in the warm air, laden with nauseous smells,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.357#coming from the neighbourhood of the kitchen.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.358#Hutin went in first. On the table, which was fixed at one end to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.359#wall, and covered with American cloth, there were only the glasses,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.360#knives, and forks, marking oft the places. A pile of clean plates stood
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.361#at each end; whilst in the middle was a big loaf, a knife sticking in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.362#it, with the handle in the air. Hutin got rid of his bottle and laid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.363#down his plate; then, after having taken his napkin from the bottom of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.364#set of pigeonholes, the sole ornament on the walls, he heaved a sigh and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.365#sat down.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.366#“And I'm fearfully hungry, too!” he murmured.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.367#“It's always like that,” replied Favier, who took his place on the left.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.368#“Nothing to eat when one is starving.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.369#The table was rapidly filling. It contained twenty-two places. At
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.370#first nothing was heard but a loud clattering of knives and forks, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.371#gormandising of big fellows with stomachs emptied by thirteen hours'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.372#daily work. Formerly the employees had an hour for meals, which enabled
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.373#them to go outside to a café and take their coffee; and they would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.374#despatch their dinner in twenty minutes, anxious to get into the street
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.375#But this stirred them up too much, they came back careless, indisposed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.376#for business; and the managers had decided that they should not go out,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.377#but pay an extra three halfpence for a cup of coffee, if they wanted it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.378#So that now they were in no hurry, but prolonged the meal, not at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.379#all anxious to go back to work before time. A great many read some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.380#newspaper, between mouthfuls, the journal folded and placed against
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.381#their bottle. Others, their first hunger satisfied, talked noisily,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.382#always returning to the eternal grievance of the bad food, the money
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.383#they had earned, what they had done the previous Sunday, and what they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.384#were going to do on the next one.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.385#“I say, what about your Robineau?” asked a salesman of Hutin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.386#The struggle between the salesmen of the silk department and their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.387#second-hand occupied all the counters. The question was discussed every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.388#evening at the Café Saint-Roch until midnight. Hutin, who was busy with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.389#his piece of beef, contented himself with replying:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.390#“Well! he's come back, Robineau has.” Then, suddenly getting angry,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.391#he resumed: “But confound it! they've given me a bit of a donkey, I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.392#believe! It's becoming disgusting, my word of honour!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.393#“You needn't grumble!” said Favier. “I was flat enough to ask for skate.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.394#It's putrid.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.395#They were all speaking at once, some complaining, some joking. At a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.396#corner of the table, against the wall, Deloche was silently eating. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.397#was afflicted with an enormous appetite, which he had never been able
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.398#to satisfy, and not earning enough to afford any extras, he cut himself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.399#enormous chunks of bread, and swallowed up the least savoury platefuls,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.400#with an air of greediness. They all laughed at him, crying: “Favier,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.401#pass your skate to Deloche. He likes it like that. And your meat, Hutin;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.402#Deloche wants it for his dessert.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.403#The poor fellow shrugged his shoulders, and did not even reply. It
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.404#wasn't his fault if he was dying of hunger. Besides, the others might
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.405#abuse the food as much as they liked, they swallowed it up all the same.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.406#But a low whistling stopped their talk; Mouret and Bour-doncle were in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.407#the corridor. For some time the complaints had become so frequent that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.408#the principals pretended to come and judge for themselves the quality
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.409#of the food. They gave thirty sous a head per day to the chief cook,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.410#who had to pay everything, provisions, coal, gas, and staff, and they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.411#displayed a naïve astonishment when the food was not good. This very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.412#morning even, each department had deputed a spokesman. Mignot and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.413#Liénard had undertaken to speak for their comrades. And in the sudden
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.414#silence, all ears were stretched out to catch the conversation going
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.415#on in the next room, where Mouret and Bourdoncle had just entered. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.416#latter declared the beef excellent; and Mignot, astounded by this quiet
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.417#affirmation, was repeating, “But chew it, and see;” whilst Liénard,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.418#attacking the skate, was gently saying, “But it stinks, sir!” Mouret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.419#then launched into a cordial speech: he would do everything for his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.420#employees' welfare, he was their father, and would rather eat dry bread
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.421#than see them badly fed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.422#“I promise you to look into the matter,” said he in conclusion, raising
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.423#his voice so that they should hear it from one end of the passage to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.424#other.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.425#The inquiry being finished, the noise of the knives and forks commenced
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.426#once more. Hutin muttered “Yes, reckon on that, and drink water! Ah,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.427#they're not stingy of soft words. Want some promises, there you are! And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.428#they continue to feed you on old boot-leather, and to chuck you out like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.429#dogs!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.430#The salesman who had already questioned him repeated: “You say that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.431#Robineau----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.432#But a noise of heavy crockery-ware drowned his voice. The men changed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.433#their plates themselves, and the piles at both ends were diminishing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.434#When a kitchen-help brought in some large tin dishes, Hutin cried out:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.435#“Baked rice! this is a finisher!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.436#“Good for a penn'orth of gum!” said Favier, serving himself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.437#Some liked it, others thought it too sticky. There were some who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.438#remained quite silent, plunged in the fiction of their newspaper,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.439#not even knowing what they were eating. They were all mopping their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.440#foreheads, the narrow cellar-like apartment was full of a ruddy steam,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.441#whilst the shadows of the passers-by were continually passing in black
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.442#bands over the untidy cloth.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.443#“Pass Deloche the bread,” cried out one of the wags.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.444#Each one cut a piece, and then dug the knife into the loaf up to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.445#handle; and the bread still went round.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.446#“Who'll take my rice for a dessert?” asked Hutin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.447#When he had concluded his bargain with a short, thin young fellow, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.448#attempted to sell his wine also; but no one would take it, it was known
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.449#to be detestable.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.450#“As I was telling you, Robineau is back,” he continued, amid the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.451#cross-fire of laughter and conversation that was going on. “Oh!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.452#his affair is a grave one. Just fancy, he has been debauching the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.453#saleswomen! Yes, and he gets them cravats to make!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.454#“Silence!” exclaimed Favier. “They're just judging him.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.455#And he pointed to Bouthemont, who was walking in the passage between
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.456#Mouret and Bourdoncle, all three absorbed in an animated conversation,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.457#carried on in a low tone. The diningroom of the managers and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.458#second-hands happened to be just opposite. Therefore, when Bouthemont
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.459#saw Mouret pass he got up, having finished, and related the affair,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.460#explaining the awkward position he was in. The other two listened, still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.461#refusing to sacrifice Robineau, a first-class salesman, who dated from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.462#Madame Hedouin's time. But when he came to the story of the neckties,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.463#Bourdoncle got angry. Was this fellow mad to interfere with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.464#saleswomen and procure them extra work? The house paid dear enough for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.465#the women's time; if they worked on their own account at night they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.466#worked less during the day in the shop, that was certain; therefore it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.467#was a robbery, they were risking their health which did not belong to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.468#them. No, the night was made for sleep; they must all sleep, or they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.469#would be sent to the right-about!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.470#“Getting rather warm!” remarked Hutin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.471#Every time the three men passed the dining-room, the shopmen watched
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.472#them, commenting on the slightest gestures. They had forgotten the baked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.473#rice, in which a cashier had just found a brace-button.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.474#“I heard the word 'cravat,'” said Favier. “And you saw how Bourdoncle's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.475#face turned pale at once.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.476#Mouret shared his partner's indignation. That a saleswoman should be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.477#reduced to work at night, seemed to him an attack on the organisation
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.478#of The Ladies' Paradise. Who was the stupid that couldn't earn enough
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.479#in the business? But when Bouthemont named Denise he softened down,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.480#and invented excuses. Ah I yes, that poor little girl; she wasn't very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.481#sharp, and was greatly burdened, it was said. Bourdoncle interrupted him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.482#to declare they ought to send her off immediately. They would never
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.483#do anything with such an ugly creature, he had always said so; and he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.484#seemed to be indulging a spiteful feeling. Mouret, perplexed, affected
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.485#to laugh. Dear me! what a severe man! couldn't they forgive her for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.486#once? They could call in the culprit and give her a scolding. In short,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.487#Robineau was the most to blame, for he ought to have dissuaded her, he,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.488#an old hand, knowing the ways of the house.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.489#“Well! there's the governor laughing now!” resumed Favier, astonished,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.490#as the group again passed the door.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.491#“Ah, by Jove!” exclaimed Hutin, “if they persist in shoving Robineau on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.492#our shoulders, we'll make it lively for them!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.493#Bourdoncle looked straight at Mouret. Then he simply assumed a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.494#disdainful expression, to intimate that he saw how it was, and thought
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.495#it idiotic. Bouthemont resumed his complaints; the salesmen threatened
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.496#to leave, and there were some very good men amongst them. But what
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.497#appeared to touch these gentlemen especially, was the rumour of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.498#Robineau's friendly relations with Gaujean; the latter, it was said, was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.499#urging the former to set up for himself in the neighbourhood, offering
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.500#him any amount of credit, to run in opposition to The Ladies' Paradise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.501#There was a pause. Ah! Robineau was thinking of showing fight, was he!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.502#Mouret had become serious; he affected a certain scorn, avoided coming
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.503#to a decision, treating it as a matter of no importance. They would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.504#see, they would speak to him. And he immediately commenced to joke with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.505#Bouthemont, whose father, arrived two days before from his little shop
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.506#at Montpellier, had been nearly choked with rage and indignation on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.507#seeing the immense hall in which his son reigned. They were still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.508#laughing about the old man, who, recovering his Southern assurance,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.509#had immediately commenced to run everything down, pretending that the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.510#drapery business would soon go to the dogs.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.511#“Here's Robineau,” said Bouthemont. “I sent him to the stock-room to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.512#avoid any unpleasant occurrence. Excuse me if I insist, but things are
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.513#in such an unpleasant state that something must be done.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.514#Robineau, who had just come in, passed by the group with a bow, on his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.515#way to the table. Mouret simply repeated: “All right, we'll see about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.516#it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.517#And they separated. Hutin and Favier were still waiting for them, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.518#on seeing they did not return, relieved their feelings. Was the governor
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.519#coming down like this to every meal, to count the mouthfuls? A nice
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.520#thing, if they could not even eat in peace! The truth was, they had just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.521#seen Robineau come in, and the governor's good-humour made them anxious
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.522#for the result of the struggle they were engaged in. They lowered their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.523#voices, trying to find fresh subjects for grumbling.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.524#“But I'm dying of hunger!” continued Hutin, aloud. “One is hungrier than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.525#ever on getting up from table!” And yet he had eaten two portions of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.526#dessert, his own and the one he had exchanged for his plate of rice. All
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.527#at once he cried out: “Hang it, I'm going in for an extra! Victor, give
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.528#me another dessert!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.529#The waiter was finishing serving the dessert. He then brought in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.530#coffee, and those who took it gave him their three sous there and then.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.531#A few fellows had gone away, dawdling along the corridor, looking for a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.532#dark corner in which they could smoke a cigarette. The others remained
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.533#at table before the heaps of greasy plates and dishes, rolling up the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.534#bread-crumbs into little bullets, going over the same old stories, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.535#the odour of broken food, and the sweltering heat that was reddening
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.536#their ears. The walls reeked with moisture, a slow asphyxia fell from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.537#the mouldy ceiling. Standing against the wall was Deloche, stuffed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.538#with bread, digesting in silence, his eyes on the air-hole; his daily
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.539#recreation, after lunch, was to watch the feet of the passers-by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.540#spinning along the street, a continual procession of living feet, big
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.541#boots, elegant boots, and ladies' tiny boots, without head or body. On
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.542#rainy days it was very dirty.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.543#“What! Already?” exclaimed Hutin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.544#A bell rang at the end of the passage, they had to make way for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.545#third lunch. The waiters came in with pails of warm water and big
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.546#sponges to clean the American cloth. Gradually the rooms became empty,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.547#the salesmen returned to their departments, lingering on the stairs. In
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.548#the kitchen, the head cook had resumed his place at the wicket, between
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.549#the pans of skate, beef, and sauce, armed with his forks and spoons,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.550#ready to fill the plates anew with the rhythmical movement of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.551#well-regulated clock. As Hutin and Favier slowly withdrew, they saw
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.552#Denise coming down.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.553#“Monsieur Robineau is back, mademoiselle,” said the former with sneering
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.554#politeness.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.555#“He is still at table,” added the other. “But if it's anything important
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.556#you can go in.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.557#Denise continued on her way without replying or turning round; but when
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.558#she passed the dining-room of the managers and second-hands, she could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.559#not help just looking in, and saw that Robineau was really there. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.560#resolved to try and speak to him in the afternoon, and continued her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.561#journey along the corridor to her dining-room, which was at the other
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.562#end.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.563#The women took their meals apart, in two special rooms. Denise entered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.564#the first one. It was also an old cellar, transformed into a refectory;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.565#but it had been fitted up with more comfort. On the oval table, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.566#middle of the apartment, the fifteen places were further apart and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.567#wine was in decanters, a dish of skate and a dish of beef with pungent
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.568#sauce occupied the two ends of the table. Waiters in white aprons
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.569#attended to the young ladies, and spared them the trouble of fetching
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.570#their portions from the wicket The management had thought that more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.571#decent.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.572#“You went round, then?” asked Pauline, already seated and cutting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.573#herself some bread.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.574#“Yes,” replied Denise, blushing, “I was accompanying a customer.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.575#But this was a falsehood. Clara nudged her neighbour. What was the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.576#matter with the “unkempt girl?” She was quite strange in her ways. One
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.577#after the other she had received letters from her lover; then, she went
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.578#running all over the shop like a madwoman, pretending to be going to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.579#work-room, where she did not even make an appearance. There was something
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.580#up, that was certain. Then Clara, eating her skate without disgust,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.581#with the indifference of a girl who had been used to nothing better than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.582#rancid bacon, spoke of a frightful drama, the account of which filled
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.583#the newspapers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.584#“You've heard about that man cutting his mistress's throat with a razor,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.585#haven't you?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.586#“Well!” said a little quiet delicate-looking girl belonging to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.587#under-linen department, “he found her with another fellow. Serve her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.588#right!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.589#But Pauline protested. What! just because one had ceased to love a man,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.590#he should be allowed to cut your throat? Ah! no, never! And stopping all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.591#at once, she turned round to the waiter, saying: “Pierre, I can't get
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.592#through this beef. Just tell them to do me an extra, an omelet, nice and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.593#soft, if possible.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.594#To pass away the time, she took out some chocolate which she began
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.595#eating with her bread, for she always had her pockets full of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.596#sweetmeats.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.597#“Certainly it isn't very amusing with such a fellow,” resumed Clara.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.598#“And some people are fearfully jealous, you know! Only the other day
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.599#there was a workman who pitched his wife into a well.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.600#She kept her eyes on Denise, thinking she had guessed her trouble on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.601#seeing her turn pale. Evidently this little prude was afraid of being
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.602#beaten by her lover, whom she no doubt deceived. It would be a lark if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.603#he came right into the shop after her, as she seemed to fear he would.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.604#But the conversation took another turn, one of the girls was giving a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.605#recipe for cleaning velvet. They then went on to speak of a piece at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.606#the Gaiety, in which some darling little children danced better than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.607#any grown-up persons. Pauline, saddened for a moment at the sight of her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.608#omelet, which was overdone, resumed her gaiety on finding it went down
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.609#fairly well.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.610#“Pass the wine,” said she to Denise. “You should go in for an omelet.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.611#“Oh! the beef is enough for me,” replied the young girl, who, to avoid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.612#expense, confined herself to the food provided by the house, no matter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.613#how repugnant it might be.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.614#When the waiter brought in the baked rice, the young ladies protested.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.615#They had refused it the previous week, and hoped it would not appear
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.616#again. Denise, inattentive, worrying about Jean after Clara's stories,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.617#was the only one to eat it; all the others looked at her with an air
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.618#of disgust. There was a great demand for extras, they gorged themselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.619#with jam. This was a sort of elegance, they felt obliged to feed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.620#themselves with their own money.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.621#“You know the gentlemen have complained,” said the little delicate girl
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.622#from the under-linen department, “and the management has promised----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.623#They interrupted her with a burst of laughter, and commenced to talk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.624#about the management. All the girls took coffee but Denise, who couldn't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.625#bear it, she said. And they lingered there before their cups, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.626#young ladies from the under-linen department in woollen dresses, with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.627#middle-class simplicity, the young ladies from the dress department
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.628#in silk, their napkins tucked under their chins, in order not to stain
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.629#their dresses, like ladies who might have come down to the servants'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.630#hall to dine with their chamber-maids. They had opened the glazed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.631#sash of the airhole to change the stifling poisoned air; but they were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.632#obliged to close it at once, the cab-wheels seemed to be passing over
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.633#the table.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.634#“Hush!” exclaimed Pauline; “here's that old beast!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.635#It was Jouve, the inspector, who was rather fond of prowling about at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.636#meal times, when the young ladies were there. He was supposed, in fact,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.637#to look after their dining-rooms. With a smiling face he would come in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.638#and walk round the tables; sometimes he would even indulge in a little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.639#gossip, and inquire if they had made a good lunch. But as he annoyed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.640#them and made them feel uncomfortable, they all hastened to get away.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.641#Although the bell had not rung, Clara was the first to disappear; the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.642#others followed her, so that soon only Denise and Pauline remained.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.643#The latter, after having drunk her coffee, was finishing her chocolate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.644#drops. All at once she got up, saying: “I'm going to send the messenger
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.645#for some oranges. Are you coming?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.646#“Presently,” replied Denise, who was nibbling at a crust, determined to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.647#wait till the last, so as to be able to see Robineau on going upstairs.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.648#However, when she found herself alone with Jouve she felt uneasy, so she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.649#quitted the table; but as she was going towards the door he stopped her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.650#saying: “Mademoiselle Baudu----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.651#Standing before her, he smiled with a paternal air. His thick grey
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.652#moustache and short cropped hair gave him a respectable military
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.653#appearance; and he threw out his chest, on which was displayed the red
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.654#ribbon of his decoration.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.655#“What is it, Monsieur Jouve?” asked she, feeling reassured. “I caught
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.656#you again this morning talking upstairs behind the carpet department You
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.657#know it is not allowed, and if I reported you---- She must be very fond
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.658#of you, your friend Pauline.” His moustache quivered, a flame lighted up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.659#his enormous nose. “What makes you so fond of each other, eh?” Denise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.660#without understanding, was again becoming seized with an uneasy feeling.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.661#He was getting too close, and was speaking right in her face.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.662#“It's true we were talking, Monsieur Jouve,” she stammered, “but there's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.663#no harm in talking a bit. You are very good to me, and I'm very much
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.664#obliged to you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.665#“I ought not to be good,” said he. “Justice, and nothing more, is my
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.666#motto. But when it's a pretty girl----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.667#And he came closer still, and she felt really afraid. Pauline's words
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.668#came back to her memory; she now remembered the stories going about,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.669#stories of girls terrified by old Jouve into buying his good-will. In
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.670#the shop, as a rule, he confined himself to little familiarities, such
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.671#as pinching the cheeks of the complaisant young ladies with his fat
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.672#fingers, taking their hands in his and keeping them there as if he had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.673#forgotten them. This was very paternal, and he only gave way to his real
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.674#nature outdoors, when they consented to accept a little refreshment at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.675#his place in the Rue des Moineaux.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.676#“Leave me alone,” murmured the young girl, drawing back. “Come,” said
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.677#he, “you are not going to play the savage with me, who always treats
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.678#you well. Be amiable, come and take a cup of tea and a slice of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.679#bread-and-butter with me this evening. You are very welcome.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.680#She was struggling now. “No! no!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.681#The dining room was empty, the waiter had not come back. Jouve,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.682#listening for the sound of any footsteps, cast a rapid glance around
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.683#him; and, very excited, losing control over himself, going beyond his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.684#fatherly familiarities, he tried to kiss her on the neck.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.685#“What a spiteful, stupid little girl. When one has a head of hair like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.686#yours one should not be so stupid. Come round this evening, just for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.687#fun.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.688#But she was very excited, shocked, and terrified at the approach of this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.689#burning face, of which she could feel the breath. Suddenly she pushed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.690#him, so roughly that he staggered and nearly fell on to the table.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.691#Fortunately, a chair saved him; but in the shock, some wine left in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.692#glass spurted on to his white necktie, and soaked his decoration. And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.693#he stood there, without wiping himself, choked with anger at such
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.694#brutality. What! when he was expecting nothing, when he was not exerting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.695#his strength, and was yielding simply to his kindness of heart!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.696#[Illustration: 0297]
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.697#“Ah, you will be sorry for this, on my word of honour!” Denise ran away.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.698#Just at that moment the bell rang; but troubled, still shuddering, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.699#forgot Robineau, and went straight to her counter, not daring to go
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.700#down again. As the sun fell on the frontage of the Place Gaillon of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.701#an afternoon, they were all stifling in the first floor rooms,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.702#notwithstanding the grey linen blinds. A few customers came, put the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.703#young ladies into a very uncomfortable, warm state, and went away
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.704#without buying anything. Every one was yawning even under Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.705#Aurélie's big sleepy eyes. Towards three o'clock, Denise, seeing the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.706#first-hand falling off to sleep, quietly slipped off, and resumed her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.707#journey across the shop, with a busy air. To put the curious ones, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.708#might be watching her, off the scent, she did not go straight to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.709#silk department; pretending to want something in the lace department,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.710#she went up to Deloche, and asked him a question; then, on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.711#ground-floor, she passed through the printed cottons department, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.712#was just going into the cravat one, when she stopped short, startled and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.713#surprised. Jean was before her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.714#“What! it's you?” she murmured, quite pale.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.715#He had on his working blouse, and was bare-headed, with his hair in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.716#disorder, the curls falling over his girlish face. Standing before a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.717#show-case of narrow black neckties, he appeared to be thinking deeply.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.718#“What are you doing here?” resumed Denise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.719#“What do you think?” replied he. “I was waiting for you. You won't let
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.720#me come. So I came in, but haven't said anything to anybody. You may
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.721#feel quite safe. Pretend not to know me, if you like.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.722#Some salesmen were already looking at them with astonishment Jean
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.723#lowered his voice. “She wanted to come with me you know. Yes, she is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.724#close by, opposite the fountain. Give me the fifteen francs quick, or we
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.725#are done for as sure as the sun is shining on us!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.726#Denise lost her head. The lookers-on were grinning, listening to this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.727#adventure. And as there was a staircase behind the cravat department
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.728#leading to the lower floor, she pushed her brother along, and quickly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.729#led him below. Downstairs he continued his story, embarrassed, inventing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.730#his facts, fearing not to be believed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.731#“The money is not for her. She is too respectable for that. And as for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.732#her husband, he does not care a straw for fifteen francs. Not for a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.733#million would he allow his wife. A glue manufacturer, I tell you. People
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.734#very well off indeed. No, it's for a low fellow, one of her friends,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.735#who has seen us together; and if I don't give him this money this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.736#evening----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.737#“Be quiet,” murmured Denise. “Presently, do get along.” They were now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.738#in the parcels office. The dead season had thrown the vast floor into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.739#a sort of torpor, in the pale light from the air-holes. It was cold as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.740#well, a silence fell from the ceiling. However, a porter was collecting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.741#from one of the compartments the few packets for the neighbourhood of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.742#the Madeleine; and, on the large sorting-table, was seated Campion, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.743#chief clerk, his legs dangling, and his eyes wandering about.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.744#Jean began again: “The husband, who has a big knife----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.745#“Get along!” repeated Denise, still pushing him forward. They followed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.746#one of the narrow corridors, where the gas was kept continually burning.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.747#To the right and the left in the dark vaults the reserve goods threw out
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.748#their shadows behind the gratings. At last she stopped opposite one of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.749#these. Nobody was likely to pass that way; but it was not allowed, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.750#she shuddered.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.751#“If this rascal says anything,” resumed Jean, “the husband, who has a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.752#big knife----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.753#“Where do you expect I can find fifteen francs?” exclaimed Denise in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.754#despair. “Can't you be more careful? You're always getting into some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.755#stupid scrape!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.756#He struck his chest. Amidst all his romantic inventions, he had almost
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.757#forgotten the exact truth. He dramatised his money wants, but there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.758#was always some immediate necessity behind this display. “By all that's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.759#sacred, it's really true this time. I was holding her like this, and she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.760#was kissing me----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.761#She stopped him again, and lost her temper, feeling on thorns,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.762#completely at a loss. “I don't want to know. Keep your wicked conduct
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.763#to yourself. It's too bad, you ought to know better! You're always
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.764#tormenting me. I'm killing myself to keep you in money. Yes, I have to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.765#stay up all night at work. Not only that, you are taking the bread out
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.766#of your little brother's mouth.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.767#Jean stood there with his mouth wide open, and all the colour left his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.768#face. What! it was not right? And he could not understand, he had always
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.769#treated his sister like a comrade, he thought it quite a natural thing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.770#to open his heart to her. But what choked him above all, was to learn
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.771#she stopped up all night. The idea that he was killing her, and taking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.772#Pépé's share as well, affected him so much that he began to cry.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.773#“You're right; I'm a scamp,” exclaimed he. “But it isn't wicked, really,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.774#far from it, and that's why one always does it! This woman, Denise, is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.775#twenty, and thought it such fun, because I'm only seventeen. Really now!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.776#I am quite furious with myself! I could slap my face!” He had taken her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.777#hands, and was kissing them and inundating them with tears. “Give me
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.778#the fifteen francs, and this shall be the last time. I swear to you.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.779#Or rather--no!--don't give me anything. I prefer to die. If the husband
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.780#murders me it will be a good riddance for you.” And as she was crying as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.781#well, he was stricken with remorse. “I say that, but of course I'm not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.782#sure. Perhaps he doesn't want to kill any one. We'll manage. I promise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.783#you that, darling. Good-bye, I'm off.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.784#But a sound of footsteps at the end of the corridor frightened them. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.785#quickly drew him close to the grating, in a dark corner. For an instant
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.786#they heard nothing but the hissing of a gas-burner near them. Then the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.787#footsteps drew nearer; and, on stretching out her neck, she recognised
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.788#Jouve, the inspector, who had just entered the corridor, with his stiff
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.789#military walk. Was he there by chance, or had some one at the door
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.790#warned him of Jean's presence? She was seized with such a fright that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.791#she knew not what to do; and she pushed Jean out of the dark spot where
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.792#they were concealed, and drove him before her, stammering out: “Be off!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.793#Be off!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.794#Both galloped along, hearing Jouve behind them, for he also had began to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.795#run. They crossed the parcels office again, and arrived at the foot of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.796#the stairs leading out into the Rue de la Michodière.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.797#“Be off!” repeated Denise, “be off! If I can, I'll send you the fifteen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.798#francs all the same.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.799#Jean, bewildered, scampered away. The inspector, who came up panting,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.800#out of breath, could only distinguish a corner of his white blouse, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.801#his locks of fair hair flying in the wind. He stood a moment to get his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.802#breath, and resume his correct appearance. He had on a brand-new white
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.803#necktie, the large bow of which shone like a snow-flake.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.804#“Well! this is nice behaviour, mademoiselle!” said he, his lips
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.805#trembling. “Yes, it's nice, very nice! If you think I'm going to stand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.806#this sort of thing in the basement, you're mistaken.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.807#And he pursued her with this whilst she was returning to the shop,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.808#overcome with emotion, unable to find a word of defence. She was sorry
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.809#now she had run away. Why hadn't she explained the matter, and brought
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.810#her brother forward? They would now go and imagine all sorts of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.811#villanies, and say what she might, they would not believe her. Once more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.812#she forgot Robineau, and went straight to her counter. Jouve immediately
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.813#went to the manager's office to report the matter. But the messenger
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.814#told him Monsieur Mouret was with Monsieur Bourdoncle and Monsieur
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.815#Robineau; they had been talking together for the last quarter of an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.816#hour. In fact, the door was halfopen, and he could hear Mouret gaily
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.817#asking Robineau if he had had a pleasant holiday; there was not the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.818#least question of a dismissal--on the contrary, the conversation fell on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.819#certain things to be done in the department.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.820#“Do you want anything, Monsieur Jouve?” exclaimed Mouret “Come in.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.821#But a sudden instinct warned the inspector. As Bourdoncle had come out,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.822#he preferred to relate the affair to him. They slowly passed through the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.823#shawl department, walking side by side, the one leaning over and talking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.824#in a low tone, the other listening, not a sign on his severe face
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.825#betraying his impressions. “All right,” said the latter at last.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.826#And as they had arrived close to the dress department, he went in. Just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.827#at that moment Madame Aurélie was scolding Denise. Where had she come
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.828#from, again? This time she couldn't say she had been to the work-room.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.829#Really, these continual absences could not be tolerated any longer.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.830#“Madame Aurélie!” cried Bourdoncle.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.831#He had decided on a bold stroke, not wishing to consult Mouret, for fear
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.832#of some weakness. The first-hand came up, and the story was once more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.833#related in a low voice. They were all waiting in the expectation of some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.834#catastrophe. At last, Madame Aurélie turned round with a solemn air.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.835#“Mademoiselle Baudu!” And her puffy emperor's mask assumed the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.836#immobility of the all-powerful: “Go and be paid!” The terrible phrase
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.837#sounded very loud in the empty department. Denise stood there pale as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.838#a ghost, without saying a word. At last she was able to ask in broken
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.839#sentences:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.840#“Me! me! What for? What have I done?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.841#Bourdoncle replied, harshly, that she knew very well, that she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.842#better not provoke any explanation; and he spoke of the cravats, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.843#said that it would be a fine thing if all the young ladies received men
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.844#down in the basement.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.845#“But it was my brother!” cried she with the grievous anger of an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.846#outraged virgin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.847#Marguerite and Clara commenced to laugh. Madame Frédéric, usually so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.848#discreet, shook her head with an incredulous air. Always her brother!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.849#Really it was very stupid! Denise looked round at all of them:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.850#Bourdoncle, who had taken a dislike to her the first day; Jouve, who had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.851#stopped to serve as a witness, and from whom she expected no justice;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.852#then these girls whom she had not been able to soften by nine months of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.853#smiling courage, who were happy, in fact, to turn her out of doors. What
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.854#was the good of struggling? what was the use of trying to impose herself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.855#on them when no one liked her? And she went away without a word,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.856#not even casting a last look towards this room where she had so long
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.857#struggled. But as soon as she was alone, before the hall staircase, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.858#deeper sense of suffering filled her grieved heart. No one liked her,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.859#and the sudden thought of Mouret had just deprived her of all idea of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.860#resignation. No! no! she could not accept such a dismissal. Perhaps he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.861#would believe this villanous story, this rendezvous with a man down in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.862#the cellars. At the thought, a feeling of shame tortured her, an anguish
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.863#with which she had never before been afflicted. She wanted to go and see
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.864#him, to explain the matter to him, simply to let him know the truth;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.865#for she was quite ready to go away as soon as he knew this. And her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.866#old fear, the shiver which chilled her when in his presence, suddenly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.867#developed into an ardent desire to see him, not to leave the house
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.868#without telling him she had never belonged to another.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.869#It was nearly five o'clock, and the shop was waking up into life again
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.870#in the cool evening air. She quickly started off for Mouret's office.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.871#But when she arrived at the door, a hopeless melancholy feeling again
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.872#took possession of her. Her tongue refused its office, the intolerable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.873#burden of existence again fell on her shoulders. He would not believe
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.874#her, he would laugh like the others, she thought; and this idea made her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.875#almost faint away. All was over, she would be better alone, out of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.876#way, dead! And, without informing Pauline or Deloche, she went at once
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.877#and took her money.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.878#“You have, mademoiselle,” said the clerk, “twenty-two days; that makes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.879#eighteen francs and fourteen sous; to which must be added seven francs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.880#for commission. That's right, isn't it?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.881#“Yes, sir. Thanks.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.882#And Denise was going away with her money, when she at last met Robineau.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.883#He had already heard of her dismissal, and promised to find the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.884#necktie-dealer. In a lower tone he tried to console her, but lost his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.885#temper: what an existence, to be at the continual mercy of a whim! to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.886#thrown out at an hour's notice, without even being able to claim a full
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.887#month's salary. Denise went up to inform Madame Cabin, saying that she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.888#would try and send for her box during the evening. It was just striking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.889#five when she found herself on the pavement of the Place Gaillon,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.890#bewildered, in the midst of the crowd of people and cabs.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.891#The same evening when Robineau got home he received a letter from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.892#management informing him, in a few lines, that for certain reasons
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.893#relating to the internal arrangements they were obliged to deprive
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.894#themselves of his services. He had been in the house seven years, and it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.895#was only that afternoon that he was talking to the principals; this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.896#was a heavy blow for him. Hutin and Favier were crowing in the silk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.897#department, as loudly as Clara and Marguerite in the dress one. A jolly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.898#good riddance! Such clean sweeps make room for the others! Deloche and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.899#Pauline were the only ones to regret Denise's departure, exchanging, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.900#the rush of business, bitter words of regret at losing her, so kind, so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.901#well behaved.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.902#“Ah,” said the young man, “if ever she succeeds anywhere else, I should
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.903#like to see her come back here, and trample on the others; a lot of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.904#good-for-nothing creatures!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.905#It was Bourdoncle who in this affair had to bear the brunt of Mouret's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.906#anger. When the latter heard of Denise's dismissal, he was exceedingly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.907#annoyed. As a rule he never interfered with the staff; but this time he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.908#affected to see an encroachment on his power, an attempt to over-ride
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.909#his authority. Was he no longer master in the place, that they dared
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.910#to give orders? Everything must pass through his hands, absolutely
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.911#everything; and he would immediately crush any one who should resist
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.912#Then, after making personal inquiries, all the while in a nervous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.913#torment which he could not conceal, he lost his temper again. This
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.914#poor girl was not lying; it was really her brother. Campion had fully
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.915#recognised him. Why was she sent away, then? He even spoke of taking her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.916#back.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.917#However, Bourdoncle, strong in his passive resistance, bent before the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.918#storm. He watched Mouret, and one day when he saw him a little calmer,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.919#ventured to say in a meaning voice: “It's better for everybody that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.920#she's gone.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.921#Mouret stood there looking very awkward, the blood rushing to his face.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.922#“Well!” replied he, laughing, “perhaps you're right. Let's go and take
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.923#a turn down stairs. Things are looking better, we took nearly a hundred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vi.924#thousand francs yesterday.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.1#CHAPTER VII.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.2#For a moment Denise stood bewildered on the pavement, in the sun which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.3#still shone fiercely at five o'clock. The July heat warmed the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.4#gutters, Paris was blazing with the chalky whiteness peculiar to it in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.5#summer-time, and which produced quite a blinding glare. The catastrophe
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.6#had happened so suddenly, they had turned her out so roughly, that she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.7#stood there, turning her money over in her pocket in a mechanical way,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.8#asking herself where she was to go, and what she was to do.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.9#A long line of cabs prevented her quitting the pavement near The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.10#Paradise. When she at last risked herself amongst the wheels she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.11#crossed over the Place Gaillon, as if she intended to go into the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.12#Louis-le-Grand; then she altered her mind, and walked towards the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.13#Saint-Roch. But still she had no plan, for she stopped at the corner of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.14#the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs, and finally followed it, after looking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.15#around her with an undecided air. Arrived at the Passage Choiseul, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.16#passed through, and found herself in the Rue Monsigny, without knowing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.17#how, and ultimately came into the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin again. Her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.18#head was filled with a fearful buzzing sensation, she thought of her box
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.19#on seeing a commissionaire; but where was she to have it taken to, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.20#why all this trouble, when an hour ago she had a bed to go to?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.21#Then her eyes fixed on the houses, she began to examine the windows.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.22#There were any number of bills, “Apartments to Let.” She saw them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.23#confusedly, repeatedly seized by the inward emotion which was agitating
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.24#her whole being. Was it possible? Left alone so suddenly, lost in this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.25#immense city in which she was a stranger, without support, without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.26#resources. She must eat and sleep, however. The streets succeeded one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.27#another, the Rue des Moulins, the Rue Sainte-Anne. She wandered about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.28#the neighbourhood, frequently retracing her steps, always brought back
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.29#to the only spot she knew really well. Suddenly she was astonished,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.30#she was again standing before The Ladies' Paradise; and to escape this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.31#obsession she plunged into the Rue de la Michodière. Fortunately Baudu
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.32#was not at his door. The Old Elbeuf appeared to be dead, behind its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.33#murky windows. She would never have dared to show herself at her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.34#uncle's, for he affected not to recognise her any more, and she did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.35#wish to become a burden to him, in the misfortune he had predicted for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.36#her. But, on the other side of the street, a yellow bill attracted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.37#her attention. “Furnished room to let.” It was the first that did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.38#frighten her, so poor did the house appear. She soon recognised it,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.39#with its two low storeys, and rusty-coloured front, crushed between The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.40#Ladies' Paradise and the old Hôtel Duvillard. On the threshold of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.41#umbrella shop, old Bourras, hairy and bearded like a prophet, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.42#with his glasses on his nose, stood studying the ivory handle of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.43#walking-stick. Hiring the whole house, he under-let the two upper floors
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.44#furnished, to lighten the rent.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.45#“You have a room, sir?” asked Denise, obeying an instinctive impulse.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.46#He raised his great bushy eyes, surprised to see her, for he knew all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.47#the young persons at The Ladies' Paradise. And, after observing her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.48#clean dress and respectable appearance, he replied: “It won't suit you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.49#“How much is it, then?” replied Denise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.50#“Fifteen francs a month.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.51#She asked to see it. On arriving in the narrow shop, and seeing that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.52#he was still eyeing her with an astonished air, she told him of her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.53#departure from the shop and of her wish not to trouble her uncle. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.54#old man then went and fetched a key hanging on a board in the back-shop,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.55#a small dark room, where he did his cooking and had his bed; beyond
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.56#that, behind a dirty window, could be seen a back-yard about six feet
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.57#square.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.58#“I'll walk in front to prevent you falling,” said Bourras, entering the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.59#damp corridor which ran along the shop.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.60#He stumbled against the lower stair, and commenced the ascent,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.61#reiterating his warnings to be careful. Look out! the rail was close
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.62#against the wall, there was a hole at the corner, sometimes the lodgers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.63#left their dust-boxes there. Denise, in complete obscurity, could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.64#distinguish nothing, only feeling the chilliness of the old damp
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.65#plaster. On the first floor, however, a small window looking into the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.66#yard enabled her to see vaguely, as at the bottom of a piece of sleeping
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.67#water, the rotten staircase, the walls black with dirt, the cracked and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.68#discoloured doors.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.69#“If only only these rooms were vacant,” resumed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.70#Bourras. “You would be very comfortable there. But they are always
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.71#occupied by ladies.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.72#On the second floor the light increased, showing up with a raw paleness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.73#the distress of the house. A journeyman-baker occupied the first room,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.74#and it was the other, the further one, that was vacant. When Bourras
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.75#had opened the door he was obliged to stay on the landing in order that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.76#Denise might enter with ease. The bed placed in the corner nearest the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.77#door, left just room enough for one person to pass. At the other end
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.78#there was a small walnut-wood chest of drawers, a deal table stained
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.79#black, and two chairs. The lodgers who did any cooking were obliged to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.80#kneel before the fire-place, where there was an earthenware stove.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.81#“You know,” said the old man, “it is not luxurious, but the view from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.82#the window is gay. You can see the people passing in the street.” And,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.83#as Denise was looking with surprise at the ceiling just above the bed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.84#where a chance lady-lodger had written her name--Ernestine--by drawing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.85#the flame of the candle over it, he added with a good-natured smile; “If
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.86#I did a lot of repairs, I should never make both ends meet. There you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.87#are; it's all I have to offer.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.88#“I shall be very well here,” declared the young girl.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.89#She paid a month in advance, asked for the linen--a pair of sheets and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.90#two towels, and made her bed without delay, happy, relieved to know
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.91#where she was going to sleep that night. An hour after she had sent a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.92#commissionaire to fetch her box, and was quite at home.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.93#During the first two months she had a terribly hard time of it. Being
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.94#unable to pay for Pépé's board, she had taken him away, and slept him on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.95#an old sofa lent by Bourras. She could not do with less than thirty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.96#sous a day, including the rent, even by consenting to live on dry bread
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.97#herself, in order to procure a bit of meat for the little one.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.98#During the first fortnight she got on pretty well, having begun her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.99#housekeeping with about ten francs; besides she had been fortunate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.100#enough to find the cravat-dealer, who paid her her eighteen francs six
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.101#sous. But after that she became completely destitute. It was in vain she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.102#applied to the various shops, at La Place Clichy, the Bon Marché, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.103#Louvre: the dead season had stopped business everywhere, they told
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.104#her to apply again in the autumn, more than five thousand employees,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.105#dismissed like her, were wandering about Paris in want of places. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.106#then tried to obtain a little work elsewhere; but in her ignorance of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.107#Paris she did not know where to apply, often accepting most ungrateful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.108#tasks, and sometimes even not getting her money. Certain evenings she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.109#gave Pépé his dinner alone, a plate of soup, telling him she had dined
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.110#out; and she would go to bed, her head in a whirl, nourished by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.111#fever which was burning her hands. When Jean dropped suddenly into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.112#the midst of this poverty, he called himself a scoundrel with such
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.113#a despairing violence that she was obliged to tell some falsehood to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.114#reassure him; and often found means of slipping a two-franc piece into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.115#his hand, to prove that she still had money. She never wept before the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.116#children. On Sundays, when she would cook a piece of veal in the stove,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.117#on her knees before the fire, the narrow room re-echoed with the gaiety
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.118#of children, careless about existence. Then, when Jean had returned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.119#to his master's and Pépé was sleeping, she spent a frightful night, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.120#anguish about the coming day.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.121#Other fears kept her awake. The two ladies on the first floor received
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.122#visitors up to a late hour; and sometimes a visitor mistook the floor
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.123#and came banging at Denise's door. Bourras having quietly told her not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.124#to answer, she buried her face under her pillow to escape hearing their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.125#oaths. Then, her neighbour, the baker, had shown a disposition to annoy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.126#her: he never came home till the morning, and would lay in wait for her,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.127#as she went to fetch her water; he even made holes in the wall, to watch
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.128#her washing herself, so that she was obliged to hang her clothes against
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.129#the wall. But she suffered still more from the annoyances of the street,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.130#the continual persecution of the passers-by. She could not go downstairs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.131#to buy a candle, in these streets swarming with the debauchees of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.132#old quarters, without feeling a warm breath behind her, and hearing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.133#crude, insulting remarks; and the men pursued her to the very end of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.134#dark passage, encouraged by the sordid appearance of the house. Why had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.135#she no lover? It astonished people, and seemed ridiculous. She would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.136#certainly have to yield one day. She herself could not have explained
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.137#why she resisted, menaced as she was by hunger, and perturbed by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.138#desires with which the air around her was warm.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.139#One evening Denise had not even any bread for Pépé's soup, when a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.140#gentleman, wearing a decoration, commenced to follow her. On arriving
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.141#opposite the passage he became brutal, and it was with a disgusted,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.142#shocked feeling that she banged the door in his face. Then, upstairs,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.143#she sat down, her hands trembling. The little one was sleeping. What
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.144#should she say if he woke up and asked for bread? And yet she had only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.145#to consent and her misery would be over, she could have money, dresses,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.146#and a fine room. It was very simple, every one came to that, it was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.147#said; for a woman alone in Paris could not live by her labour. But her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.148#whole being rose up in protestation, without indignation against the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.149#others, simply averse to the disgrace of the thing. She considered life
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.150#a matter of logic, good conduct, and courage.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.151#Denise frequently questioned herself in this way. An old love story
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.152#floated in her memory, the sailor's betrothed whom her love guarded
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.153#from all perils. At Valognes she had often hummed over this sentimental
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.154#ballad, gazing on the deserted street. Had she also a tender affection
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.155#in her heart that she was so brave? She still thought of Hutin, full of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.156#uneasiness. Morning and evening she saw him pass under her window. Now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.157#that he was second-hand he walked by himself, amid the respect of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.158#simple salesmen. He never raised his head, she thought she suffered from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.159#his vanity, and watched him pass without any fear of being discovered.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.160#And as soon as she saw Mouret, who also passed every day, she began to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.161#tremble, and, quickly concealed herself, her bosom heaving. He had no
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.162#need to know where she was lodging. Then she felt ashamed of the house,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.163#and suffered at the idea of what he thought of her, although perhaps
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.164#they would never meet again.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.165#Denise still lived amidst the agitation caused by The Ladies' Paradise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.166#A simple wall separated her room from her old department; and, from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.167#early morning, she went over her day's work, feeling the arrival of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.168#crowd, the increased bustle of business. The slightest noise shook the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.169#old house hanging on the flank of the colossus; she felt the gigantic
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.170#pulse beating. Besides, she could not avoid certain meetings. Twice
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.171#she had found herself face to face with Pauline, who had offered her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.172#services, grieved to see her so unfortunate; and she had even been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.173#obliged to tell a falsehood to avoid receiving her friend or paying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.174#her a visit, one Sunday, at Baugé's. But it was more difficult still to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.175#defend herself against Deloche's desperate affection; he watched her,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.176#aware of all her troubles, waited for her in the doorways. One day he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.177#wanted to lend her thirty francs, a brother's savings, he said, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.178#a blush. And these meetings made her regret the shop, continually
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.179#occupying her with the life they led inside, as if she had not quitted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.180#it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.181#No one ever called upon Denise. One afternoon she was surprised by a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.182#knock. It was Colomban. She received him standing. He, looking very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.183#awkward, stammered at first, asked how she was getting on, and spoke of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.184#The Old Elbeuf.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.185#Perhaps it was Uncle Baudu who had sent him, regretting his rigour;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.186#for he continued to pass his niece without taking any notice of her,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.187#although quite aware of her miserable position. But when she plainly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.188#questioned her visitor, he appeared more embarrassed than ever. No,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.189#no, it was not the governor who had sent him; and he finished by naming
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.190#Clara--he simply wanted to talk about Clara. Little by little he became
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.191#bolder, and asked Denise's advice, supposing that she could be useful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.192#to him with her old friend. It was in vain that she tried to dishearten
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.193#him, by reproaching him with the pain he was causing Geneviève, all for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.194#this heartless girl. He came up another day, and got into the habit of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.195#coming to see her. This sufficed for his timid passion; he continually
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.196#commenced the same conversation, unable to resist, trembling with joy to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.197#be with a girl who had approached Clara. And this caused Denise to live
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.198#more than ever at The Ladies' Paradise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.199#It was towards the end of September that the young girl experienced the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.200#blackest misery. Pépé had fallen ill, having caught a severe cold. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.201#ought to have been nourished with good broth, and she had not even a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.202#piece of bread. One evening, completely conquered, she was sobbing, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.203#one of those sombre straits which drive women on to the streets, or into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.204#the Seine, when old Bourras gently knocked at the door. He brought a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.205#loaf, and a milk-can full of broth.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.206#“There! there's something for the youngster,” said he in his abrupt way.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.207#“Don't cry like that; it annoys my lodgers.” And as she thanked him in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.208#fresh outburst of tears, he resumed: “Do keep quiet! To-morrow come and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.209#see me. I've some work for you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.210#Bourras, since the terrible blow dealt him by The Ladies' Paradise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.211#by their opening an umbrella department, had ceased to employ any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.212#workwomen. He did everything himself to save expenses--the cleaning,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.213#mending, and sewing. His trade was also diminishing, so that he was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.214#sometimes without work. And he was obliged to invent something to do the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.215#next day, when he installed Denise in a corner of his shop. He felt that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.216#he could not let any one die of hunger in his house.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.217#“You'll have two francs a day,” said he. “When you find something
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.218#better, you can leave me.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.219#She was afraid of him, and did the work so quickly that he hardly knew
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.220#what else to give her to do. He had given her some silk to stitch, some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.221#lace to repair. During the first few days she did not dare raise her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.222#head, uncomfortable to know he was close to her, with his lion-like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.223#mane, hooked nose, and piercing eyes, under his thick bushy eyebrows.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.224#His voice was harsh, his gestures extravagant, and the mothers of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.225#neighbourhood often frightened their youngsters by threatening to send
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.226#for him, as they would for a policeman. However, the boys never passed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.227#his door without calling out some insulting words, which he did not even
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.228#seem to hear. All his maniacal anger was directed against the scoundrels
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.229#who dishonoured his trade by selling cheap trashy articles, which dogs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.230#would not consent to use.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.231#Denise trembled whenever he burst out thus: “Art is done for, I tell
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.232#you! There's not a single respectable handle made now. They make sticks,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.233#but as for handles, it's all up! Bring me a proper handle, and I'll give
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.234#you twenty francs!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.235#He had a real artist's pride; not a workman in Paris was capable of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.236#turning out a handle like his, light and strong. He carved the knobs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.237#especially with charming ingenuity, continually inventing fresh designs,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.238#flowers, fruit, animals, and heads, subjects conceived and executed in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.239#a free and life-like style. A little pocket-knife sufficed, and he spent
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.240#whole days, spectacles on nose, chipping bits of boxwood and ebony.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.241#“A pack of ignorant beggars,” said he, “who are satisfied with sticking a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.242#certain quantity of silk on so much whalebone! They buy their handles by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.243#the gross, handles readymade. And they sell just what they like! I tell
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.244#you, art is done for!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.245#Denise began to take courage. He had insisted on having Pépé down in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.246#shop to play, for he was wonderfully fond of children. When the little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.247#one was crawling about on all-fours, neither of them had room to move,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.248#she in her corner doing the mending, he near the window, carving with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.249#his little pocket-knife. Every day now brought on the same work and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.250#the same conversation. Whilst working, he continually pitched into The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.251#Ladies' Paradise; never tired of explaining how affairs stood. He had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.252#occupied his house since 1845, and had a thirty years' lease, at a rent
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.253#of eighteen hundred francs a year; and, as he made a thousand francs out
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.254#of his four furnished rooms, he only paid eight hundred for the shop.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.255#It was a mere trifle, he had no expenses, and could thus hold out for a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.256#long time still. To hear him, there was no doubt about his triumph;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.257#he would certainly swallow up the monster. Suddenly he would interrupt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.258#himself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.259#“Have they got any dog's heads like that?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.260#And he would blink his eyes behind his glasses, to judge the dog's head
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.261#he was carving, with its lip turned up and fangs out, in a life-like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.262#growl. Pépé, delighted with the dog, would get up, placing his two
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.263#little arms on the old man's knee.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.264#“As long as I make both ends meet I don't care a hang about the rest,”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.265# the latter would resume, delicately shaping the dog's tongue with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.266#point of his knife. “The scoundrels have taken away my profits; but if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.267#I'm making nothing I'm not losing anything yet, or at least but very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.268#little. And, you see, I'm ready to sacrifice everything rather than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.269#yield.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.270#He would brandish his knife, and his white hair would blow about in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.271#storm of anger.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.272#“But,” Denise would mildly observe, without raising her eyes from her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.273#needle, “if they made you a reasonable offer, it would be wiser to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.274#accept.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.275#Then his ferocious obstinacy would burst forth. “Never! If my head were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.276#under the knife I would say no, by heavens! I've another ten years'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.277#lease, and they shall not have the house before then, even if I should
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.278#have to die of hunger within the four bare walls. Twice already have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.279#they tried to get over me. They offered me twelve thousand francs for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.280#my good-will, and eighteen thousand francs for the last ten years of my
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.281#lease; in all thirty thousand. Not for fifty thousand even! I have them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.282#in my power, and intend to see them licking the dust before me!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.283#“Thirty thousand francs! it's a good sum,” Denise would resume. “You
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.284#could go and establish yourself elsewhere. And suppose they were to buy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.285#the house?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.286#Bourras, putting the finishing touches to his dog's tongue, would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.287#appear absorbed for a moment, an infantine laugh pervading his venerable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.288#prophet's face. Then he would, continue: “The house, no fear! They spoke
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.289#of buying it last year, and offered eighty thousand francs, twice as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.290#much as it's worth. But the landlord, a retired fruiterer, as big a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.291#scoundrel as they, wanted to make them shell out more. But not only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.292#that, they are suspicious about me; they know I'm not so likely to give
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.293#way. No! no! here I am, and here I intend to stay. The emperor with all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.294#his cannon could not turn me out.” Denise never dared say any more, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.295#would go on with her work, whilst the old man continued to break out in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.296#short sentences, between two cuts with his knife, muttering something to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.297#the effect that the game had hardly commenced, later on they would see
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.298#wonderful things, he had certain plans which would sweep away their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.299#umbrella counter; and, in his obstinacy, there appeared a personal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.300#revolt of the small manufacturer against the threatening invasion of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.301#the great shops. Pépé, however, would at last climb on his knees, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.302#impatiently stretch out his hand towards the dog's head.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.303#“Give it me, sir.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.304#“Presently, my child,” the old man would reply in a voice that suddenly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.305#became tender. “He hasn't any eyes; we must make his eyes now.” And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.306#whilst carving the eye he would continue talking to Denise. “Do you hear
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.307#them? Isn't there a roar next door? That's what exasperates me more than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.308#anything, my word of honour! to have them always on my back with their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.309#infernal locomotive-like noise.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.310#It made his little table tremble, he asserted. The whole shop was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.311#shaken, and he would spend the entire afternoon without a customer, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.312#the trepidation of the crowd which overflowed The Ladies' Paradise. It
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.313#was from morning to night a subject for eternal grumbling. Another good
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.314#day's work, they were knocking against the wall, the silk department
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.315#must have cleared ten thousand francs; or else he made merry over a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.316#showery day which had killed the receipts. And the slightest rumours,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.317#the most unimportant noises, furnished him with subjects of endless
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.318#comment.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.319#“Ah! some one has slipped down! Ah, if they could only all fall and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.320#break their backs! That, my dear, is a dispute between some ladies. So
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.321#much the better! So much the better! Do you hear the parcels falling on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.322#to the lower floor? It's disgusting!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.323#It did not do for Denise to discuss his explanations, for he retorted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.324#bitterly by reminding her of the shameful way they had dismissed her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.325#She was obliged to relate for the hundredth time her life in the dress
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.326#department, the hardships she had endured at first, the small unhealthy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.327#bedrooms, the bad food, and the continual struggle between the salesmen;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.328#and they were thus talking about the shop from morning to night,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.329#absorbing it hourly in the very air they breathed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.330#“Give it me, sir,” Pépé would repeat, with eager outstretched hands.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.331#The dog's head finished, Bourras would hold it at a distance, then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.332#examine it closely with childish glee. “Take care, it will bite you!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.333#There, go and play, and don't break it, if you can help it.” Then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.334#resuming his fixed idea, he would shake his fist at the wall. “You may
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.335#do all you can to knock the house down. You sha'n't have it, even if you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.336#invade the whole neighbourhood.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.337#Denise had now her daily bread assured her, and she was extremely
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.338#grateful to the old umbrella-dealer, whose good heart she felt beneath
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.339#his strange violent ways. She had a strong desire, however, to find some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.340#work elsewhere, for she often saw him inventing some trifle for her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.341#to do; she fully understood that he did not require a workwoman in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.342#present slack state of his business, and that he was employing her out
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.343#of pure charity. Six months had passed thus, and the dull winter season
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.344#had again returned. She was despairing of finding a situation before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.345#March, when, one evening in January, Deloche, who was watching for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.346#her in a doorway, gave her a bit of advice. Why did she not go and see
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.347#Robineau; perhaps he might want some one?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.348#In September, Robineau had decided to buy Vinçard's silk business,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.349#trembling all the time lest he should compromise his wife's sixty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.350#thousand francs. He had paid forty thousand for the good-will and stock,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.351#and was starting with the remaining twenty thousand. It was not much,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.352#but he had Gaujean behind him to back him up with any amount of credit.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.353#Since his disagreement with The Ladies' Paradise, the latter had been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.354#longing to stir up a system of competition against the colossus; and he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.355#thought victory certain, by creating special shops in the neighbourhood,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.356#where the public could find a large and varied choice of articles. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.357#rich Lyons manufacturers, such as Dumonteil, were the only ones who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.358#could accept the big shops' terms, satisfied to keep their looms going
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.359#with them, looking for their profits by selling to less important
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.360#houses. But Gaujean was far from having the solidity and staying power
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.361#possessed by Dumonteil. For a long time a simple commission agent, it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.362#was only during the last five or six years that he had had looms of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.363#own, and he still had a lot of work done by other makers, furnishing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.364#them with the raw material and paying them by the yard. It was precisely
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.365#this system which, increasing his manufacturing expenses, had prevented
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.366#him competing with Dumonteil for the supply of the Paris Paradise. This
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.367#had filled him with rancour; he saw in Robineau the instrument of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.368#decisive battle to be declared against these drapery bazaars which he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.369#accused of ruining the French manufacturers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.370#When Denise called she found Madame Robineau alone. Daughter of an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.371#overseer in the Department of Highways, entirely ignorant of business
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.372#matters, she still retained the charming awkwardness of a girl educated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.373#in a Blois convent She was dark, very pretty, with a gentle, cheerful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.374#manner, which gave her a great charm. She adored her husband, living
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.375#solely by his love. As Denise was about to leave her name Robineau came
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.376#in, and engaged her at once, one of his two saleswomen having left the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.377#previous day to go to The Ladies' Paradise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.378#“They don't leave us a single good hand,” said he. “However, with you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.379#I shall feel quite easy, for you are like me, you can't be very fond of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.380#them. Come to-morrow.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.381#In the evening Denise hardly knew how to announce her departure to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.382#Bourras. In fact, he called her an ungrateful girl, and lost his temper.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.383#Then when, with tears in her eyes, she tried to defend herself by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.384#intimating that she could see through his charitable conduct, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.385#softened down, said that he had plenty of work, that she was leaving him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.386#just as he was about to bring out an umbrella of his invention.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.387#“And Pépé?” asked he.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.388#This was Denise's great trouble; she dared not take him back to Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.389#Gras, and could not leave him alone in the bedroom, shut up from morning
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.390#to night.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.391#“Very good, Til keep him,” said the old man; “he'll be all right in my
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.392#shop. We'll do the cooking together.” Then, as she refused, fearing it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.393#might inconvenience him, he thundered out: “Great heavens! have you no
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.394#confidence in me? I sha'n't eat your child!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.395#Denise was much happier at Robineau's. He only paid her sixty francs a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.396#month, with her food, without giving her any commission on the sales,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.397#just the same as in the old-fashioned houses. But she was treated with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.398#great kindness, especially by Madame Robineau, always smiling at her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.399#counter. He, nervous, worried, was sometimes rather abrupt. At the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.400#expiration of the first month, Denise was quite one of the family, like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.401#the other saleswoman, a silent, consumptive, little body. The Robineaus
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.402#were not at all particular before them, talking of the business at table
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.403#in the back shop, which looked on to a large yard. And it was there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.404#they decided one evening on starting the campaign against The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.405#Paradise. Gaujean had come to dinner. After the usual roast leg of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.406#mutton, he had broached the subject in his Lyons voice, thickened by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.407#Rhône fogs.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.408#“It's getting unbearable,” said he. “They go to Dumonteil, purchase
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.409#the sole right in a design, and take three hundred pieces straight off,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.410#insisting on a reduction of ten sous a yard; and, as they pay ready
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.411#money, they enjoy moreover the profit of eighteen per cent discount.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.412#Very often Dumonteil barely makes four sous a yard out of it He works to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.413#keep his looms going, for a loom that stands still is a dead loss. Under
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.414#these circumstances how can you expect that we, with our limited plant,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.415#and especially with our makers, can keep up the struggle?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.416#Robineau, pensive, forgot his dinner. “Three hundred pieces!” he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.417#murmured. “I tremble when I take a dozen, and at ninety days. They can
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.418#mark up a franc or two francs cheaper than us. I have calculated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.419#there is a reduction of at least fifteen per cent, on their catalogued
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.420#articles, when compared with our prices. That's what kills the small
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.421#houses.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.422#He was in a period of discouragement. His wife, full of anxiety, was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.423#looking at him with a tender air. She understood very little about the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.424#business, all these figures confused her; she could not understand why
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.425#people took such trouble, when it was so easy to be gay and love one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.426#another. However, it sufficed that her husband wished to conquer, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.427#she became as impassioned as he himself, and would have stood to her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.428#counter till death.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.429#“But why don't all the manufacturers come to an understanding together?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.430# resumed Robineau, violently. “They could then lay down the law, instead
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.431#of submitting to it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.432#Gaujean, who had asked for another slice of mutton, was slowly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.433#masticating. “Ah! why, why? The looms must be kept going, I tell you.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.434#When one has weavers everywhere, in the neighbourhood of Lyons, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.435#Gard, in the Isère, they can't stand still a day without an enormous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.436#loss. Then we who sometimes employ makers having ten or fifteen looms
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.437#are better able to control the output, as far as regards the stock,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.438#whilst the big manufacturers are obliged to have continual outlets, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.439#quickest and largest possible, so that they are on their knees before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.440#the big shops. I know three or four who out-bid each other, and who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.441#would sooner work at a loss than not obtain the orders. But they make
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.442#up for it with the small houses like yours. Yes, if they exist through
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.443#them, they make their profit out of you. Heaven knows how the crisis
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.444#will end!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.445#“It's odious!” exclaimed Robineau, relieved by this cry of anger.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.446#Denise was quietly listening. She was secretly for the big shops, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.447#her instinctive love of logic and life.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.448#They had relapsed into silence, and were eating some potted French
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.449#beans; at last she ventured to say in a cheerful tone, “The public does
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.450#not complain.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.451#Madame Robineau could not suppress a little laugh, which annoyed her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.452#husband and Gaujean. No doubt the customer was satisfied, for, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.453#the end, it was the customer who profited by the fall in prices. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.454#everybody must live; where would they be if, under the pretext of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.455#the general welfare, the consumer was fattened at the expense of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.456#producer? And then commenced a long discussion. Denise affected to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.457#joking, all the while producing solid arguments. All the middle-men
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.458#disappeared, the manufacturing agents, representatives, commission
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.459#agents, and this greatly contributed to cheapen the articles; besides,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.460#the manufacturers could no longer live without the big shops, for as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.461#soon as one of them lost their custom, failure became a certainty; in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.462#short, it was a natural commercial evolution. It would be impossible to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.463#prevent things going on as they ought to, when everybody was working for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.464#that, whether they liked it or not.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.465#“So you are for those who turned you out into the street?” asked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.466#Gaujean.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.467#Denise became very red. She herself was surprised at the vivacity of her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.468#defence. What had she at heart, that such a flame should have invaded
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.469#her bosom?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.470#“Dear me, no!” replied she. “Perhaps I'm wrong, for you are more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.471#competent to judge than I. I simply express my opinion. The prices,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.472#instead of being settled as formerly by fifty houses, are now fixed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.473#by four or five, which have lowered them, thanks to the power of their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.474#capital, and the strength of their immense business. So much the better
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.475#for the public, that's all!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.476#Robineau was not angry, but had become grave, keeping his eyes fixed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.477#on the table-cloth. He had often felt this breath of the new style of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.478#business, this evolution of which the young girl spoke; and he would ask
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.479#himself in his clear, quiet moments, why he should wish to resist such a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.480#powerful current, which must carry everything before it Madame Robineau
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.481#herself, on seeing her husband deep in thought, glanced with approval at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.482#Denise, who had modestly resumed her silent attitude.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.483#“Come,” resumed Gaujean, to cut short the argument, “all that is simply
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.484#theory. Let's talk of our matter.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.485#After the cheese, the servant brought in some jam and some pears. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.486#took some jam, eating it with a spoon, with the unconscious greediness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.487#of a big man very fond of sugar.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.488#“To begin with, you must attack their Paris Paradise, which has been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.489#their success of the year. I have come to an understanding with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.490#several of my brother manufacturers at Lyons, and have brought you an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.491#exceptional offer--a black silk, that you can sell at five and a half.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.492#They sell theirs at five francs twelve sous, don't they? Well! this will
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.493#be two sous less, and that will suffice to upset them.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.494#At this Robineau's eyes lighted up again. In his continual nervous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.495#torment, he often skipped like this from despair to hope. “Have you got
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.496#a sample?” asked he. And when Gaujean drew from his pocket-book a little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.497#square of silk, he went into raptures, exclaiming: “Why, this is a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.498#handsomer silk than the Paris Paradise! In any case it produces a better
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.499#effect, the grain is coarser. You are right, we must make the attempt If
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.500#I don't bring them to my feet, I'll give up this time!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.501#Madame Robineau, sharing this enthusiasm, declared the silk superb, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.502#Denise herself thought they would succeed. The latter part of the dinner
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.503#was thus very gay. They talk in a loud tone; it seemed that The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.504#Paradise was at its last gasp. Gaujean, who was finishing the pot of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.505#jam, explained what enormous sacrifices he and his colleagues would be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.506#obliged to make to deliver such an article at this low price; but they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.507#would ruin themselves rather than yield; they had sworn to kill the big
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.508#shops. As the coffee came in the gaiety was greatly increased by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.509#arrival of Vinçard, who had just called, in passing, to see how his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.510#successor was getting on.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.511#“Famous!” cried he, feeling the silk. “You'll floor them, I stake my
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.512#life! Ah! you owe me a rare good thing; I told you this was a golden
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.513#affair!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.514#He had just taken a restaurant at Vincennes. It was an old, cherished
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.515#idea, slyly nourished while he was struggling in the silk business,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.516#trembling for fear he should not sell it before the crash came, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.517#swearing to himself that he would put his money into an undertaking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.518#where he could rob at his ease. The idea of a restaurant had struck him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.519#at the wedding of a cousin, who had been made to pay ten francs for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.520#a bowl of dish water, in which floated some Italian paste. And, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.521#presence of the Robineaus, the joy he felt in having saddled them with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.522#a badly-paying business of which he despaired of ever getting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.523#rid, enlarged still further his face with its round eyes and large
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.524#loyal-looking mouth, a face beaming with health.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.525#“And your pains?” asked Madame Robineau, good-naturedly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.526#“My pains?” murmured he, astonished.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.527#“Yes, those rheumatic pains which tormented you so much when you were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.528#here.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.529#He then recollected, and blushed slightly. “Oh, I suffered,” and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.530#blushed slightly. “Oh I suffer from them still! However, the country
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.531#air, you know, has done wonders for me. Never mind, you've done a good
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.532#stroke of business. Had it not been for my rheumatics, I could soon have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.533#retired with ten thousand francs a year. My word of honour!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.534#A fortnight later, the struggle commenced between Robineau and The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.535#Ladies' Paradise. It became celebrated, and occupied for a time the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.536#whole Parisian market. Robineau, using his adversary's weapons, had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.537#advertised extensively in the newspapers. Besides that, he made a fine
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.538#display, piling up enormous bales of the famous silk in his windows,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.539#with immense white tickets, displaying in giant figures the price, five
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.540#francs and a half. It was this figure that caused a revolution among
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.541#the women; two sous cheaper than at The Ladies' Paradise, and the silk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.542#appeared stronger. From the first day a crowd of customers flocked in.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.543#Madame Marty bought a dress she did not want, pretending it to be a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.544#bargain; Madame Bourdelais thought the silk very fine, but preferred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.545#waiting, guessing no doubt what would happen. And, indeed the following
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.546#week, Mouret boldly reduced The Paris Paradise by four sous, after a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.547#lively discussion with Bourdoncle and the other managers, in which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.548#he had succeeded in inducing them to accept the challenge, even at a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.549#sacrifice; for these four sous represented a dead loss, the silk being
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.550#sold already at strict cost price. It was a heavy blow to Robineau, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.551#did not think his rival would reduce; for this suicidal competition,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.552#these losing sales, were then unknown; and the tide of customers,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.553#attracted by the cheapness, had immediately flown back towards the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.554#Neuve-Saint-Augustin, whilst the shop in the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.555#gradually emptied.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.556#Gaujean came up from Lyons; there were hasty confabulations, and they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.557#finished by coming to a most heroic resolution; the silk should be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.558#lowered in price, they would sell it at five francs six sous, beneath
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.559#which no one could go, without folly. The next day Mouret marked his at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.560#five francs four sous. After that it became a mania: Robineau replied by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.561#five francs three sous, when Mouret at once ticketed his at five francs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.562#and two sous. Neither lowered more than a sou at a time now, losing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.563#considerable sums as often as they made this present to the public. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.564#customers laughed, delighted with this duel, moved by the terrible
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.565#blows dealt each other by the two houses to please them. At last Mouret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.566#ventured as low as five francs; his staff paled before such a challenge
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.567#thrown down to fortune. Robineau, utterly beaten, out of breath, stopped
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.568#also at five francs, not having the courage to go any lower. And they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.569#rested at their positions, face to face, with the massacre of their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.570#goods around them.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.571#But if honour was saved on both sides, the situation was becoming fatal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.572#for Robineau. The Ladies' Paradise had money at its disposal and a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.573#patronage which enabled it to balance its profits; whilst he, sustained
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.574#by Gaujean alone, unable to recoup his losses on other articles,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.575#was exhausted, and slipped daily a little further on the verge of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.576#bankruptcy. He was dying from his hardihood, notwithstanding the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.577#numerous customers that the hazards of the struggle had brought him. One
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.578#of his secret torments was to see these customers slowly quitting him,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.579#returning to The Ladies' Paradise, after the money he had lost and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.580#efforts he had made to conquer them.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.581#One day he quite lost patience. A customer, Madame de Boves, had come to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.582#his shop for some mantles, for he had added a ready-made department to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.583#his business. She could not make up her mind, complaining of the quality
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.584#of the goods. At last she said: “Their Paris Paradise is a great deal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.585#stronger.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.586#Robineau restrained himself, assuring her that she was mistaken, with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.587#tradesman's politeness, all the more respectful, because he was afraid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.588#to allow his anger to burst forth.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.589#“But just look at the silk of this mantle!” resumed she, “one would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.590#really take it for so much cobweb. You may say what you like, sir, their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.591#silk at five francs is like leather compared with this.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.592#He did not reply, the blood rushing to his face, and his lips tightly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.593#closed. In point of fact he had ingeniously thought of buying some of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.594#his rival's silk for these mantles. So that it was Mouret, not he, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.595#lost on the material. He simply cut off the selvage.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.596#“Really you think the Paris Paradise thicker?” murmured he.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.597#“Oh! a hundred times!” said Madame de Boves. “There's no comparison.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.598#This injustice on her part, her running down the goods in this way,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.599#filled him with indignation. And, as she was still turning the mantle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.600#over with a disgusted air, a little piece of the blue and silver
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.601#selvage, not cut off, appeared under the lining. He could not contain
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.602#himself any longer; he confessed he would even have given his head.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.603#“Well, madame, this _is_ Paris Paradise. I bought it myself! Look at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.604#border.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.605#Madame de Boves went away greatly annoyed, and a number of ladies
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.606#quitted him when the affair became known. And he, amid this ruin, when
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.607#the fear for the future seized him, only trembled for his wife, who had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.608#been brought up in a happy, peaceful home, and would never be able to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.609#endure a life of poverty. What would become of her if a catastrophe
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.610#threw them into the street, with a load of debts? It was his fault, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.611#ought never to have touched her money. She was obliged to comfort him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.612#Wasn't the money as much his as hers? He loved her dearly, and she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.613#wanted nothing more; she gave him everything, her heart and her life.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.614#They could be heard in the back shop embracing one another. Little by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.615#little, the affairs and ways of the house became more regular; every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.616#month their losses increased, in a slow proportion which postponed the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.617#fatal issue. A tenacious hope sustained them, they still announced the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.618#near discomfiture of The Ladies' Paradise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.619#“Pooh!” he would say, “we are young yet The future is ours.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.620#“And besides, what matters, if you have done what you wanted to do?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.621# resumed she. “As long as you are satisfied, I am as well, darling.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.622#Denise's affection increased for them on seeing their tenderness. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.623#trembled, feeling their inevitable fall; but she dared not interfere. It
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.624#was then she fully understood the power of the new system of business,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.625#and became impassioned for this force which was transforming Paris. Her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.626#ideas were ripening, a woman's grace was developing out of the savage
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.627#child newly arrived from Valognes. In fact, her life was a pretty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.628#pleasant one, notwithstanding the fatigue and the little money she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.629#earned. When she had spent all the day on her feet, she had to go
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.630#straight home, and look after Pépé, whom old Bourras insisted on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.631#feeding, fortunately; but there was still a lot to do: a shirt to wash,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.632#stockings to mend; without mentioning the noise made by the youngster,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.633#which made her head ache fit to split. She never went to bed before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.634#midnight. Sunday was her hardest day: she cleaned her room, and mended
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.635#her own things, so busy that it was often five o'clock before she could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.636#dress. However, she sometimes went out for health's sake, taking the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.637#little one for a long walk, out towards Neuilly; and their treat was to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.638#drink a cup of milk there at a dairyman's, who allowed them to sit down
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.639#in his yard. Jean disdained these excursions; he put in an appearance
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.640#now and again on week-day evenings, then disappeared, pretending to have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.641#other visits to pay; he asked for no more money, but he arrived with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.642#such a melancholy face, that his sister, anxious, always managed to keep
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.643#a five-franc piece for him. That was her sole luxury.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.644#“Five francs!” he would exclaim each time. “My stars! you're too good!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.645#It just happens, there's the stationer's wife----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.646#“Not another word,” Denise would say; “I don't want to know.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.647#But he thought she was accusing him of boasting. “I tell you she's the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.648#wife of a stationer! Oh! something magnificent!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.649#Three months passed away, spring was returning. Denise refused to return
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.650#to Joinville with Pauline and Bauge. She sometimes met them in the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.651#Saint-Roch, when she left the shop in the evening. Pauline, one evening
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.652#when she was alone, confided to her that she was very likely going to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.653#marry her lover; it was she who was hesitating, for they did not care
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.654#for married saleswomen at The Ladies' Paradise. This idea of marriage
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.655#surprised Denise, she did not dare to advise her friend. One day, just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.656#as Colomban had stopped her near the fountain to talk about Clara, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.657#latter was crossing the road; and Denise was obliged to run away, for he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.658#implored her to ask her old comrade if she would marry him. What was the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.659#matter with them all? why were they tormenting themselves like this? She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.660#thought herself very fortunate not to be in love with any one.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.661#“You've heard the news?” cried out the umbrella dealer to her one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.662#evening on her return home from business.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.663#“No, Monsieur Bourras.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.664#“Well! the scoundrels have bought the Hôtel Duvillard. I'm hemmed in on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.665#all sides!” He was waving his long arms about, in a burst of fury
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.666#which made his white mane stand up on end. “A regular mixed-up affair,”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.667# resumed the old man. “It appears that the hôtel belonged to the Credit
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.668#Immobilier, the president of which, Baron Hartmann, has just sold it to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.669#our famous Mouret. Now they've got me on the right, on the left, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.670#at the back, just in the way I'm holding the knob of this stick in my
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.671#hand!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.672#It was true, the sale was to have been concluded the previous day.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.673#Bourras's small house, hemmed in between The Ladies' Paradise and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.674#Hôtel Duvillard, hanging on like a swallow's nest in a crack of a wall,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.675#seemed sure to be crushed, as soon as the shop invaded the hôtel, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.676#the time had now arrived. The colossus had turned the feeble obstacle,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.677#and was surrounding it with a pile of goods, threatening to swallow it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.678#up, to absorb it by the sole force of its giant aspiration.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.679#Bourras could feel the embrace which was making his shop creak. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.680#thought he could see the place getting smaller; he was afraid of being
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.681#absorbed himself, of being carried to the other side with his umbrellas
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.682#and sticks, so loudly was the terrible machine roaring just then.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.683#“Do you hear them?” asked he. “One would think they were eating up the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.684#walls even! And in my cellar, in the attic, everywhere, there's the same
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.685#noise as of a saw going through the plaster. Never mind! I don't fancy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.686#they'll flatten me out like a sheet of paper. I'll stick here, even if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.687#they blow up my roof, and the rain should fall in bucketfuls on my bed!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.688#It was just at this moment that Mouret caused fresh proposals to be made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.689#to Bourras; they would increase the figure, they would give him fifty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.690#thousand francs for his good-will and the remainder of the lease. This
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.691#offer redoubled the old man's anger; he refused in an insulting manner.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.692#How these scoundrels must rob people to be able to pay fifty thousand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.693#francs for a thing not worth ten thousand. And he defended his shop as a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.694#young girl defends her virtue, for honour's sake.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.695#Denise noticed Bourras was pre-occupied during the next fortnight. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.696#wandered about in a feverish manner, measuring the walls of his house,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.697#surveying it from the middle of the street with the air of an architect.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.698#Then one morning some workmen arrived. This was the decisive blow. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.699#had conceived the bold idea of beating The Ladies' Paradise on its own
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.700#ground by making certain concessions to modern luxury. The customers,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.701#who often reproached him about his dark shop, would certainly come back
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.702#again, when they saw it bright and new. In the first place, the workmen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.703#stopped up the crevices and whitewashed the frontage, then they painted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.704#the woodwork a light green, and even carried the splendour so far as to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.705#gild the sign-board. A sum of three thousand francs, held in reserve
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.706#by Bourras as a last resource, was swallowed up in this way. The whole
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.707#neighbourhood was in a state of revolution; people came to look at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.708#him amid all these riches, losing his head, no longer able to find
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.709#the things he was accustomed to. He did not seem to be at home in this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.710#shining frame, in this tender setting; he seemed frightened, with his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.711#long beard and white hair. The people passing on the opposite side
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.712#of the street were astonished on seeing him waving his arms about and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.713#carving his handles. And he was in a state of fever, afraid of dirtying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.714#his shop, plunging further into this luxurious business, which he did
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.715#not at all understand.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.716#The same as with Robineau, the campaign against The Ladies' Paradise was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.717#opened by Bourras. The latter had just brought out his invention,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.718#the automatic umbrella, which later on was to become popular. But The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.719#Paradise people immediately improved on the invention, and a struggle of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.720#prices commenced. Bourras had an article at one franc and nineteen sous,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.721#in zanella, with steel mounting, everlasting, said the ticket, But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.722#he was especially anxious to vanquish his competitors with his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.723#handles--bamboo, dogwood, olive, myrtle, rattan, every imaginable sort
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.724#of handle. The Paradise people, less artistic, paid more attention to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.725#the material, extolling their alpacas and mohairs, their twills and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.726#sarcenets.. And they came out victorious. Bourras, in despair, repeated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.727#that art was done for, that he was reduced to carving his handles for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.728#pleasure, without any hope of selling them.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.729#“It's my fault!” cried he to Denise. “I never ought to have kept a lot
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.730#of rotten articles, at one franc nineteen sous! That's where these new
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.731#notions lead one to. I wanted to follow the example of these brigands;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.732#so much the better if I'm ruined by it!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.733#The month of July was very warm, and Denise suffered greatly in her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.734#narrow room, under the roof. So after leaving the shop, she sometimes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.735#went and fetched Pépé, and instead of going up-stairs at once, went
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.736#for a stroll in the Tuileries Gardens until the gates were closed. One
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.737#evening as she was walking under the chestnut-trees she suddenly stopped
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.738#with surprise; a few yards off, walking straight towards her, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.739#thought she recognised Hutin. But her heart commenced to beat violently.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.740#It was Mouret, who had dined over the water, and was hurrying along on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.741#foot to call on Madame Desforges. At the abrupt movement she made to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.742#escape him, he caught sight of her. The night was coming on, but still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.743#he recognised her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.744#“Ah, it's you, mademoiselle!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.745#She did not reply, astonished that he should deign to stop. He, smiling,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.746#concealed his constraint beneath an air of amiable protection.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.747#“You are still in Paris?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.748#“Yes, sir,” said she at last.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.749#She was slowly drawing back, desirous of making a bow and continuing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.750#her walk. But he turned and followed her under the black shadows of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.751#chestnut-trees. The air was getting cooler, some children were laughing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.752#in the distance, trundling their hoops.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.753#“This is your brother, is it not?” resumed he, looking at Pépé.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.754#The little boy, frightened by the unusual presence of a gentleman, was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.755#gravely walking by his sister's side, holding her tightly by the hand.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.756#“Yes, sir,” replied she once more.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.757#She blushed, thinking of the abominable inventions circulated by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.758#Marguerite and Clara. No doubt Mouret understood why she was blushing,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.759#for he quickly added: “Listen, mademoiselle, I have to apologise to you.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.760#Yes, I should have been happy to have told you sooner how much I regret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.761#the error that has been made. You were accused too lightly of a fault.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.762#But the evil is done. I simply wanted to assure you that every one in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.763#our establishment now knows of your affection for your brothers,” he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.764#continued, with a respectful politeness to which the saleswomen in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.765#The Ladies' Paradise were little accustomed. Denise's confusion had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.766#increased; but her heart was filled with joy. He knew, then, that she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.767#had given herself to no one! Both remained silent; he continued beside
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.768#her, regulating his walk to the child's short steps; and the distant
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.769#murmurs of the city were dying away under the black shadows of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.770#spreading chestnut-trees. “I have only one reparation to offer you,”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.771# resumed he. “Naturally, if you would like to come back to us----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.772#She interrupted him, and refused with a feverish haste. “No, sir, I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.773#cannot. Thank you all the same, but I have found another situation.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.774#He knew it, they had informed him she was with Robineau; and leisurely,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.775#on a footing of amiable equality, he spoke of the latter, rendering
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.776#him full justice. A very intelligent fellow, but too nervous. He would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.777#certainly come to grief: Gaujean had burdened him with a very heavy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.778#business, in which they would both suffer. Denise, conquered by this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.779#familiarity, opened her mind further, and allowed it to be seen that she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.780#was for the big shops in the war between them and the small traders:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.781#she became animated, citing examples, showing herself well up in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.782#question, even expressing new and enlightened ideas. He, charmed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.783#listened to her in surprise; and turned round, trying to distinguish
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.784#her features in the growing darkness. She seemed still the same with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.785#her simple dress and sweet face; but from this modest bashfulness, there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.786#seemed to exhale a penetrating perfume, of which he felt the powerful'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.787#influence. Decidedly this little girl had got used to the air of Paris,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.788#she was becoming quite a woman, and was really perturbing, so sensible,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.789#with her beautiful hair, overflowing with tenderness.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.790#“As you are on our side,” said he, laughing, “why do you stay with our
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.791#adversaries? I fancy, too, they told me you lodged with Bourras.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.792#“A very worthy man,” murmured she.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.793#“No, not a bit of it! he's an old idiot, a madman who will force me
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.794#to ruin him, though I should be glad to get rid of him with a fortune!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.795#Besides, your place is not in his house, which has a bad reputation. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.796#lets to certain women----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.797#But feeling that the young girl was confused, he hastened to add: “One
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.798#can be respectable anywhere, and there's even more merit in remaining so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.799#when one is so poor.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.800#They went on a few steps in silence. Pépé seemed to be listening with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.801#the attentive air of a sharp child. Now and again he raised his eyes to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.802#his sister, whose burning hand, quivering with sudden starts, astonished
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.803#him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.804#“Look here!” resumed Mouret, gaily, “will you be my ambassador? I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.805#intended increasing my offer to-morrow--of proposing eighty thousand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.806#francs to Bourras. Do you speak to him first about it. Tell him he's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.807#cutting his own throat. Perhaps he'll listen to you, as he has a liking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.808#for you, and you'll be doing him a real service.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.809#“Very well!” said Denise, smiling also, “I will deliver your message,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.810#but I am afraid I shall not succeed.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.811#And a fresh silence ensued, neither of them having anything more to say.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.812#He attempted to talk of her uncle Baudu; but had to give it up on seeing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.813#the young girl's uneasiness. However, they continued to walk side by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.814#side, and at last found themselves near the Rue de Rivoli, in a path
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.815#where it was still light. On coming out of the darkness of the trees it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.816#was like a sudden awakening. He understood that he could not detain her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.817#any longer.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.818#“Good night, mademoiselle.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.819#“Good night, sir.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.820#But he did not go away. On raising his eyes he perceived in front of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.821#him, at the corner of the Rue d'Alger, the lighted windows at Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.822#Desforges's, whither he was bound. And looking at Denise, whom he could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.823#now see, in the pale twilight, she appeared to him very puny beside
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.824#Henriette. Why was it she touched his heart in this way? It was a stupid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.825#caprice.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.826#“This little man is getting tired,” resumed he, just for something to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.827#say. “Remember, mind, that our house is always open to you; you've only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.828#to knock, and I'll give you every compensation possible. Good night,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.829#mademoiselle.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.830#“Good night, sir,”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.831#When Mouret quitted her, Denise went back under the chestnut-trees,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.832#in the black shadow. For a long time she walked on without any object,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.833#between the enormous trunks, her face burning, her head in a whirl of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.834#confused ideas. Pépé still had hold of her hand, stretching out his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.835#short legs to keep pace with her. She had forgotten him. At last he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.836#said:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.837#“You go too quick, little mother.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.838#At this she sat down on a bench; and as he was tired, the child went to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.839#sleep on her lap. She held him there, nestling to her virgin bosom,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.840#her eyes lost far away in the darkness. When, an hour later on, they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.841#returned slowly to the Rue de la Michodière, she had regained her usual
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.842#quiet, sensible expression.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.843#“Hell and thunder!” shouted Bourras, when he saw her coming, “the blow
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.844#is struck. That rascal of a Mouret has just bought my house.” He was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.845#half mad, and was striking himself in the middle of the shop with such
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.846#outrageous gestures that he almost threatened to break the windows. “Ah!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.847#the scoundrel! It's the fruiterer who's written to tell me this. And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.848#how much do you think he has got for the house? One hundred and fifty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.849#thousand francs, four times its value! There's another thief, if you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.850#like! Just fancy, he has taken advantage of my embellishments, making
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.851#capital out of the fact that the house has been done up. How much longer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.852#are they going to make a fool of me?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.853#The thought that his money spent on paint and white-wash had brought
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.854#the fruiterer a profit exasperated him. And now Mouret would be his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.855#landlord; he would have to pay him! It was beneath this detested
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.856#competitor's roof, that he must live in future! Such a thought raised
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.857#his fury to the highest possible pitch.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.858#“Ah! I could hear them digging a hole through the wall. At this moment,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.859#they are here eating out of my very plate, so to say!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.860#And the shop shook under his heavy fist which he banged on the counter;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.861#he made the umbrellas and the parasols dance again. Denise, bewildered,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.862#could not get in a word. She stood there, motionless, waiting for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.863#end of his tirade; whilst Pépé, very tired, had fallen asleep on a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.864#chair. At last, when Bourras became a little calmer, she resolved to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.865#deliver Mouret's message. No doubt the old man was irritated, but the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.866#excess even of his anger, the blind alley in which he found himself,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.867#might determine an abrupt acceptance.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.868#“I've just met some one,” she commenced. “Yes, a person from The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.869#Paradise, very well informed. It appears that they are going to offer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.870#you eighty thousand francs to-morrow.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.871#“Eighty thousand francs!” interrupted he, in a terrible voice; “eighty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.872#thousand francs! Not for a million now!” She tried to reason with him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.873#But at that moment the shop door opened, and she suddenly drew back,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.874#pale and silent. It was her uncle Baudu, with his yellow face and aged
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.875#look. Bourras seized his neighbour by the button-hole, and roared out
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.876#in his face without allowing him to say a word, as if goaded on by his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.877#presence:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.878#“What do you think they have the cheek to offer me? Eighty thousand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.879#francs! They've got so far, the brigands! they think I'm going to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.880#sell myself like a prostitute. Ah! they've bought the house, and think
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.881#they've now got me. Well! it's all over, they sha'n't have it! I might
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.882#have given way, perhaps; but now it belongs to them, let them try and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.883#take it!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.884#“So the news is true?” said Baudu in his slow voice. “I had heard of it,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.885#and came over to know if it was so.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.886#“Eighty thousand francs!” repeated Bourras. “Why not a hundred thousand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.887#at once? It's this immense sum of money that makes me indignant Do they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.888#think they can make me commit a knavish trick with their money! They
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.889#sha'n't have it, by heavens! Never, never, you hear me?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.890#Denise gently observed, in her calm, quiet way: “They'll have it in nine
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.891#years' time, when your lease expires.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.892#And, notwithstanding her uncle's presence, she begged of the old man to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.893#accept. The struggle was becoming impossible, he was fighting against a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.894#superior force; he would be mad to refuse the fortune offered him. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.895#he still replied no. In nine years' time he hoped to be dead, so as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.896#not to see it “You hear, Monsieur Baudu,” resumed he, “your niece is on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.897#their side, it's her they have employed to corrupt me. She's with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.898#brigands, my word of honour!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.899#Baudu, who up to then had appeared not to notice Denise, now raised his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.900#head, with the morose movement that he affected when standing at his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.901#shop door, every time she passed. But, slowly, he turned round and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.902#looked at her, and his thick lips trembled.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.903#“I know it,” replied he in a half-whisper, and he continued to look at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.904#her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.905#Denise, affected almost to tears, thought him greatly changed by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.906#trouble. Perhaps he was stricken with remorse for not having assisted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.907#her during the time of misery she had just passed through. Then the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.908#sight of Pépé sleeping on the chair, amidst the noise of the discussion,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.909#seemed to suddenly inspire him with compassion.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.910#“Denise,” said he simply, “come to-morrow and have dinner with us and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.911#bring the little one. My wife and Geneviève asked me to invite you if I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.912#met you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.913#She turned very red, and went up and kissed him. And as he was going
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.914#away, Bourras, delighted at this reconciliation, cried out to him again:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.915#“Just talk to her, she isn't a bad sort. As for me, the house may fall,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.916#I shall be found in the ruins.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.917#“Our houses are already falling, neighbour,” said Baudu with a sombre
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:vii.918#air. “We shall all be crushed under them.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.1#CHAPTER VIII.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.2#At this time the whole neighbourhood was talking of the great
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.3#thoroughfare to be opened from the Bourse to the new Opera House, under
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.4#the name of the Rue du Dix-Décembre. The expropriation judgments had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.5#just been delivered, two gangs of demolishers were already attacking the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.6#opening at the two ends, the first pulling down the old mansions in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.7#the Rue Louis-le-Grand, the other destroying the thin walls of the old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.8#Vaudeville; and one could hear the picks getting closer. The Rue de
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.9#Choiseul and the Rue de la Michodière got quite excited over their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.10#condemned houses. Before a fortnight passed, the opening would make a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.11#great hole in these streets, letting in the sun and air.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.12#But what stirred up the district still more, was the work going on at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.13#The Ladies' Paradise. Considerable enlargements were talked of,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.14#gigantic shops having frontages in the Rue de la Michodière, the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.15#Neuve-Saint-Augustin, and the Rue Monsigny. Mouret, it was said,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.16#had made arrangements with Baron Hartmann, chairman of the Credit
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.17#Immobilier, and he would occupy the whole block, except the future
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.18#frontage in the Rue du Dix-Décembre, on which the baron wished to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.19#construct a rival to the Grand Hôtel. The Paradise people were buying up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.20#leases on all sides, the shops were closing, the tenants moving; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.21#in the empty buildings an army of workmen were commencing the various
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.22#alterations under a cloud of plaster. In the midst of this disorder,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.23#old Bourras's narrow hovel was the only one that remained standing and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.24#intact, obstinately sticking between the high walls covered with masons.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.25#When, the next day, Denise went with Pépé to her uncle Baudu's,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.26#the street was just at that moment blocked up by a line of tumbrels
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.27#discharging bricks before the Hôtel Duvillard. Baudu was standing at his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.28#shop door looking on with a gloomy air. As The Ladies' Paradise became
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.29#larger, The Old Elbeuf seemed to get smaller. The young girl thought the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.30#windows looked blacker than ever, and more and more crushed beneath the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.31#low first storey, with its prison-like bars; the damp had still further
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.32#discoloured the old green sign-board, a sort of distress oozed from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.33#whole frontage, livid in hue, and, as it were, grown thinner.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.34#“Here you are, then!” said Baudu. “Take care! they would run right over
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.35#you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.36#Inside the shop, Denise experienced the same heart-broken sensation; she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.37#found it darker, invaded more than ever by the somnolence of approaching
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.38#ruin; empty corners formed dark and gloomy holes, the dust was invading
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.39#the counters and drawers, whilst an odour of saltpetre rose from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.40#bales of cloth that were no longer moved about. At the desk Madame Baudu
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.41#and Geneviève were standing mute and motionless, as in some solitary
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.42#spot, where no one would come to disturb them. The mother was hemming
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.43#some dusters. The daughter, her hands spread on her knees, was gazing at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.44#the emptiness before her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.45#“Good evening, aunt,” said Denise; “I'm delighted to see you again, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.46#if I have hurt your feelings, I hope you will forgive me.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.47#Madame Baudu kissed her, greatly affected. “My poor child,” said she,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.48#“if I had no other troubles, you would see me gayer than this.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.49#“Good evening, cousin,” resumed Denise, kissing Geneviève on the cheeks.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.50#The latter woke up with a sort of start, and returned her kisses,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.51#without finding a word to say. The two women then took up Pépé, who was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.52#holding out his little arms, and the reconciliation was complete.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.53#“Well! it's six o'clock, let's go to dinner,” said Baudu. “Why haven't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.54#you brought Jean?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.55#“But he was to come,” murmured Denise, embarrassed. “I saw him this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.56#morning, and he faithfully promised me. Oh! we must not wait for him;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.57#his master has kept him, I dare say.” She suspected some extraordinary
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.58#adventure, and wished to apologise for him in advance.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.59#“In that case, we will commence,” said her uncle. Then turning towards
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.60#the obscure depths of the shop, he added:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.61#“Come on, Colomban, you can dine with us. No one will come.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.62#Denise had not noticed the shopman. Her aunt explained to her that they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.63#had been obliged to get rid of the other salesman and the young lady.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.64#Business was getting so bad that Colomban sufficed; and even he spent
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.65#many idle hours, drowsy, falling off to sleep with his eyes open. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.66#gas was burning in the dining-room, although they were enjoying long
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.67#summer days. Denise slightly shivered on entering, seized by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.68#dampness falling from the walls. She once more beheld the round table,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.69#the places laid on the American cloth, the window drawing its air and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.70#light from the dark and fetid back yard. And these things appeared to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.71#her to be gloomier than ever, and tearful like the shop.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.72#“Father,” said Geneviève, uncomfortable for Denise's sake, “shall I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.73#close the window? there's rather a bad smell.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.74#He smelt nothing, and seemed surprised. “Shut the window if you like,”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.75# replied he at last. “But we sha'n't get any air then.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.76#And indeed they were almost stifled. It was a family dinner, very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.77#simple. After the soup, as soon as the servant had served the boiled
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.78#beef, the old man as usual commenced about the people opposite. At first
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.79#he showed himself very tolerant, allowing his niece to have a different
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.80#opinion.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.81#“Dear me! you are quite free to support these great hairbrained houses.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.82#Each one has his ideas, my girl. If you were not disgusted at being so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.83#disgracefully chucked out you must have strong reasons for liking them;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.84#and even if you went back again, I should think none the worse of you.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.85#No one here would be offended, would they?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.86#“Oh, no!” murmured Madame Baudu.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.87#Denise quietly gave her reasons, as she had at Robineau's: the logical
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.88#evolution in business, the necessities of modern times, the greatness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.89#of these new creations, in short, the growing well-being of the public.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.90#Baudu, his eyes opened, and his mouth clamming, listened with a visible
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.91#tension of intelligence. Then, when she had finished, he shook his head.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.92#“That's all phantasmagoria, you know. Business is business, there's no
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.93#getting over that. I own that they succeed, but that's all. For a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.94#long time I thought they would smash up; yes, I expected that, waiting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.95#patiently--you remember? Well, no, it appears that now-a-days thieves
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.96#make fortunes, whilst honest people die of hunger. That's what we've
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.97#come to. I'm obliged to bow to facts. And I do bow, on my word, I do
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.98#bow!” A deep anger was gradually rising within him. All at once he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.99#flourished his fork. “But The Old Elbeuf will never give way! I said
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.100#as much to Bourras, you know, 'Neighbour, you're going over to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.101#cheapjacks; your paint and your varnish are a disgrace.'”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.102#“Eat your dinner!” interrupted Madame Baudu, feeling anxious, on seeing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.103#him so excited.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.104#“Wait a bit, I want my niece thoroughly to understand my motto. Just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.105#listen, my girl: I'm like this decanter, I don't budge. They succeed, so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.106#much the worse for them! As for me, I protest--that's all!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.107#The servant brought in a piece of roast veal. He cut it up with his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.108#trembling hands; but he no longer had his correct glance, his skill in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.109#weighing the portions. The consciousness of his defeat deprived him of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.110#the confidence he used to have as a respected employer. Pépé thought his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.111#uncle was getting angry, and they had to pacify him, by giving him some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.112#dessert, some biscuits which were near his plate. Then Baudu, lowering
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.113#his voice, tried to talk of something else. For a moment he spoke of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.114#demolitions going on, approving of the Rue du Dix-Décembre, the cutting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.115#of which would certainly improve the business of the neighbourhood. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.116#then again he returned to The Ladies' Paradise; everything brought him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.117#back to it, it was a kind of complaint. They were covered with plaster,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.118#and business was stopped since the builders' carts had commenced
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.119#to block up the street. It would soon be really ridiculous, in its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.120#immensity; the customers would lose themselves. Why not have the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.121#central markets at once? And, in spite of his wife's supplicating looks,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.122#notwithstanding his own effort, he went on from the works to the amount
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.123#of business done in the big shop. Was it not inconceivable? In less
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.124#than four years they had increased their figures five-fold; the annual
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.125#receipts, formerly eight million francs, now attained the sum of forty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.126#millions, according to the last balance-sheet. In fact it was a piece of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.127#folly, a thing that had never been seen before, and against which it was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.128#perfectly useless to struggle. They were always increasing, they had now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.129#a thousand employees and twenty-eight departments. These twenty-eight
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.130#departments enraged him more than anything else. No doubt they had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.131#duplicated a few, but others were quite new; for instance, a furniture
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.132#department, and a department for fancy goods. The idea! Fancy goods!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.133#Really these people were not at all proud, they would end by selling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.134#fish. Baudu, though affecting to respect Denise's opinions, attempted to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.135#convert her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.136#“Frankly, you can't defend them. What would you say were I to add a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.137#hardware department to my cloth business? You would say I was mad.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.138#Confess, at least, that you don't esteem them.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.139#And as the young girl simply smiled, feeling uncomfortable,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.140#understanding the uselessness of good reasons, he resumed:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.141#“In short, you are on their side. We won't talk about it any more, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.142#ifs useless to let that part us again. It would be too much to see them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.143#come between me and my family! Go back with them, if you like; but pray
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.144#don't worry me with any more of their stories!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.145#A silence ensued. His former violence was reduced to this feverish
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.146#resignation. As they were suffocating in the narrow room, heated by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.147#the gas-burner, the servant had to open the window again; and the damp,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.148#pestilential air from the yard blew into the apartment. A dish of stewed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.149#potatoes appeared, and they helped themselves slowly, without a word.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.150#“Look at those two,” recommenced Baudu, pointing with his knife to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.151#Geneviève and Colomban. “Ask them if they like your Ladies' Paradise.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.152#Side by side in the usual place where they had found themselves twice
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.153#a-day for the last twelve years, the engaged couple were eating in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.154#moderation, and without uttering a word. He, exaggerating the coarse
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.155#good-nature of his face, seemed to be concealing, behind his drooping
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.156#eyelashes, the inner flame which was devouring him; whilst she, her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.157#head bowed lower beneath her too heavy hair, seemed to be giving way
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.158#entirely, as if ravaged by a secret grief.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.159#“Last year was very disastrous,” explained Baudu, “and we have been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.160#obliged to postpone the marriage, not for our own pleasure; ask them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.161#what they think of your friends.” Denise, in order to pacify him,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.162#interrogated the young people.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.163#“Naturally I can't be very fond of them,” replied Geneviève. “But never
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.164#fear, every one doesn't detest them.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.165#And she looked at Colomban, who was rolling up some bread-crumbs with an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.166#absorbed air. When he felt the young girl's gaze directed towards him,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.167#he broke out into a series of violent exclamations: “A rotten shop!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.168#A lot of rogues, every man-jack of them! A regular pest in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.169#neighbourhood!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.170#“You hear him!' You hear him!” exclaimed Baudu, delighted. “There's one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.171#they'll never get hold of! Ah! my boy, you're the last of the old stock,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.172#we sha'n't see any more!” But Geneviève, with her severe and suffering
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.173#look, still kept her eyes on Colomban, diving into the depths of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.174#heart. And he felt troubled, he redoubled his invectives. Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.175#Baudu was watching them with an anxious air, as if she foresaw another
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.176#misfortune in this direction. For some time her daughter's sadness had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.177#frightened her, she felt her to be dying. “The shop is left to take
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.178#care of itself,” said she at last, quitting the table, desirous of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.179#putting an end to the scene. “Go and see, Colomban; I fancy I heard some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.180#one.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.181#They had finished, and got up. Baudu and Colomban went to speak to a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.182#traveller, who had come for orders. Madame Baudu carried Pépé off to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.183#show him some pictures. The servant had quickly cleared the table, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.184#Denise was lounging by the window, looking into the little back yard,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.185#when turning round she saw Geneviève still in her place, her eyes fixed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.186#on the American cloth, which was still damp from the sponge having been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.187#passed over it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.188#“Are you suffering, cousin?” she asked.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.189#The young girl did not reply, obstinately studying a rent in the cloth,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.190#too preoccupied by the reflections passing through her mind. Then she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.191#raised her head with pain, and looked at the sympathising face bent over
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.192#hers. The others had gone, then? What was she doing on this chair? And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.193#suddenly a flood of sobs stifled her, her head fell forward on the edge
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.194#of the table. She wept on, wetting her sleeve with her tears.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.195#“Good heavens! what's the matter with you?” cried Denise in dismay.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.196#“Shall I call some one?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.197#Geneviève nervously seized her by the arm, and held her back,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.198#stammering: “No, no, stay. Don't let mamma know! With you I don't mind;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.199#but not the others--not the others! It's not my fault, I assure you.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.200#It was on finding myself all alone. Wait a bit; I'm better, and Pm not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.201#crying now.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.202#But sudden attacks kept seizing her, causing her frail body to tremble.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.203#It seemed as though the weight of her hair was weighing down her head.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.204#As she was rolling her poor head on her folded arms, a hair-pin came
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.205#out, and her hair fell over her neck, burying it in its folds. Denise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.206#quietly, for fear of attracting attention, tried to console her. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.207#undid her dress, and was heart-broken on seeing how fearfully thin she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.208#was. The poor girl's bosom was as hollow as that of a child. Denise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.209#took the hair by handfuls, that superb head of hair which seemed to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.210#absorbing all her life, and twisted it up, to clear it away, and give
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.211#her a little air.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.212#“Thanks, you are very kind,” said Geneviève. “Ah! I'm not very stout, am
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.213#I? I used to be stouter, but it's all gone away. Do up my dress or mamma
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.214#might see my shoulders. I hide them as much as I can. Good heavens! I'm
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.215#not at all well, I'm not at all well.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.216#However, the attack passed away, and she sat there completely worn out,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.217#looking fixedly at her cousin. After a pause she abruptly asked: “Tell
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.218#me the truth: does he love her?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.219#Denise felt a blush rising to her cheek. She was perfectly well aware
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.220#that Geneviève referred to Colomban and Clara; but she pretended to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.221#surprised.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.222#“Who, dear?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.223#Geneviève shook her head with an incredulous air. “Don't tell
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.224#falsehoods, I beg of you. Do me the favour of setting my doubts at rest.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.225#You must know, I feel it. Yes, you have been this girl's comrade, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.226#I've seen Colomban run after you, and talk to her in a low voice. He was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.227#giving you messages for her, wasn't he? Oh! for pity's sake, tell me the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.228#truth; I assure you it will do me good.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.229#Never had Denise been in such an awkward position. She lowered her eyes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.230#before this almost dumb girl, who yet guessed all. However, she had the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.231#strength to deceive her still. “But it's you he loves!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.232#Geneviève turned away in despair. “Very well, you won't tell me
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.233#anything. However, I don't care, I've seen them. He's continually going
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.234#outside to look at her. She, upstairs, laughs like a bad woman. Of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.235#course they meet out of doors.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.236#“As for that, no, I assure you!” exclaimed Denise, forgetting herself,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.237#carried away by the desire to give her, at least, that consolation.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.238#The young girl drew a long breath, and smiled feebly. Then with the weak
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.239#voice of a convalescent: “I should like a glass of water. Excuse me if I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.240#trouble you. Look, over there in the sideboard.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.241#When she got hold of the bottle, she drank a large glassful right off,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.242#keeping Denise away with one hand, the latter being afraid Geneviève
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.243#might do herself harm.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.244#“No, no, let me be; I'm always thirsty. In the night I get up to drink.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.245# There was a fresh silence. Then she went on again quietly: “If you only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.246#knew, I've been accustomed to the idea of this marriage for the last ten
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.247#years. I was still wearing short dresses, when Colomban was courting me.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.248#I hardly remember how things have come about By always living together,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.249#being shut up here together, without any other distractions between us,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.250#I must have ended by believing him to be my husband before he really
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.251#was. I didn't know whether I loved him. I was his wife, and that's all.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.252#And now he wants to go off with another girl! Oh, heavens! my heart is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.253#breaking! You see, it's a grief that I've never felt before. It hurts
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.254#me in the bosom, and in the head; then it spreads every where, and is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.255#killing me.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.256#Her eyes filled with tears. Denise, whose eyelids were also wet with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.257#pity, asked her: “Does my aunt suspect anything?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.258#“Yes, mamma has her suspicions, I think. As to papa, he is too worried,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.259#and does not know the pain he is causing me by postponing this marriage.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.260#Mamma has questioned me several times, greatly alarmed to see me pining
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.261#away. She has never been very strong herself, and has often said: 'My
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.262#poor child, I've not made you very strong.' Besides, one doesn't grow
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.263#much in these shops. But she must find me getting really too thin now.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.264#Look at my arms; would you believe it?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.265#And with a trembling hand she again took up the water bottle. Her cousin
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.266#tried to prevent her drinking.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.267#“No, I'm so thirsty, let me drink.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.268#They could hear Baudu talking in a loud voice. Then yielding to an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.269#inspiration of her tender heart, Denise knelt down before Geneviève,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.270#throwing her arms round her neck, kissing her, and assuring her that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.271#everything would turn out all right, that she would marry Colomban, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.272#she would get well, and live happily. But she got up quickly, her uncle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.273#was calling her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.274#“Jean is here. Come along.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.275#It was indeed Jean, looking rather scared, who had come to dinner. When
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.276#they told him it was striking eight, he looked amazed. Impossible! He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.277#had only just left his master's. They chaffed him. No doubt he had come
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.278#by way of the Bois de Vincennes. But as soon as he could get near his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.279#sister, he whispered to her: “It's a little laundry-girl who was taking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.280#back some linen. I've got a cab outside by the hour. Give me five
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.281#francs.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.282#He went out a minute, and then returned to dinner, for Madame Baudu
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.283#would not hear of his going away without taking, at least, a plate of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.284#soup. Genevieve had reappeared in her usual silent and retiring manner.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.285#Colomban was half asleep behind the counter. The evening passed away,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.286#slow and melancholy, only animated by Baudu's step, as he walked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.287#from one end of the empty shop to the other. A single gas-burner was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.288#alight--the shadow of the low ceiling fell in large masses, like black
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.289#earth from a ditch.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.290#Several months passed away. Denise came in nearly every evening to cheer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.291#up Geneviève a bit, but the house became more melancholy than ever. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.292#works opposite were a continual torment, which intensified their bad
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.293#luck. Even when they had an hour of hope--some unexpected joy--the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.294#falling of a tumbrel-load of bricks, the sound of the saw of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.295#stonecutter, or the simple call of a mason, sufficed at once to mar
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.296#their pleasure. In fact, the whole neighbourhood felt the shock. From
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.297#the boarded enclosure, running along and blocking up the three streets,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.298#there issued a movement of feverish activity. Although the architect
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.299#used the existing buildings, he altered them in various ways to adapt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.300#them to their new uses; and right in the centre at the opening caused by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.301#the court-yards, he was building a central gallery as big as a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.302#church, which was to terminate with a grand entrance in the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.303#Neuve-Saint-Augustin right in the middle of the frontage. They had, at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.304#first, experienced great difficulty in laying the foundations, for they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.305#had come on to some sewer deposits and loose earth, full of human
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.306#bones. Besides that, the boring of the well had made the neighbours very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.307#anxious--a well three hundred feet deep, destined to give two hundred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.308#gallons a minute. They had now got the walls up to the first storey;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.309#the entire block was surrounded by scaffolding, regular towers of timber
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.310#work. There was an incessant noise from the grinding of the windlasses
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.311#hoisting up the stone, the abrupt discharge of iron bars, the clamour of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.312#this army of workmen, accompanied by the noise of picks and hammers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.313#But above all, what deafened the people was the sound of the machinery.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.314#Everything went by steam, screeching whistles rent the air; whilst, at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.315#the slightest gust of wind, clouds of plaster flew about and covered the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.316#neighbouring roofs like a fall of snow. The Baudus in despair looked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.317#on at this implacable dust penetrating everywhere--getting through the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.318#closest woodwork, soiling the goods in their shop, even gliding into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.319#their beds; and the idea that they must continue to breathe it--that it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.320#would finish by killing them--empoisoned their existence.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.321#The situation, however, was destined to become worse still, for in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.322#September, the architect, afraid of not being ready, decided to carry
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.323#on the work at night also. Powerful electric lamps were established,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.324#and the uproar became continuous. Gangs of men relieved each other;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.325#the hammers never stopped, the engines whistled night and day; the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.326#everlasting clamour seemed to raise and scatter the white dust The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.327#Baudus now had to give up the idea of sleeping even; they were shaken in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.328#their beds; the noises changed into nightmare as soon as they fell off
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.329#to sleep. Then, if they got up to calm their fever, and went, with bare
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.330#feet, to look out of the window, they were frightened by the vision
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.331#of The Ladies' Paradise flaring in the darkness like a colossal forge,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.332#where their ruin was being forged. Along the half-built walls, dotted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.333#with open bays, the electric lamps threw a large blue flood of light,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.334#of a blinding intensity. Two o'clock struck--then three, then four; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.335#during the painful sleep of the neighbourhood, the works, increased
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.336#by this lunar brightness, became colossal and fantastic, swarming with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.337#black shadows, noisy workmen, whose profiles gesticulated on the crude
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.338#whiteness of the new plastering.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.339#Baudu was quite right. The small traders in the neighbouring streets
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.340#were receiving another mortal blow. Every time The Ladies' Paradise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.341#created new departments there were fresh failures among the shopkeepers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.342#of the district The disaster spread, one could hear the cracking of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.343#the oldest houses. Mademoiselle Tatin, at the under-linen shop in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.344#Passage Choiseul, had just been declared bankrupt; Quinette, the glover,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.345#could hardly hold out another six months; the furriers, Vanpouille, were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.346#obliged to sub-let a part of their premises; and if the Bédorés, brother
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.347#and sister, the hosiers, still kept on in the Rue Gaillon, they were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.348#evidently living on money saved formerly. And now more smashes were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.349#going to be added to those long since foreseen; the department for fancy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.350#goods threatened a toy-shopkeeper in the Rue Saint-Roch, Deslignières, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.351#big, full-blooded man; whilst the furniture department attacked Messrs.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.352#Piot and Rivoire, whose shops were sleeping in the shadow of the Passage
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.353#Sainte-Anne. It was even feared that an attack of apoplexy would carry
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.354#off the toyman, who had gone into a terrible rage on seeing The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.355#Paradise mark up purses at thirty per cent, reduction. The furniture
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.356#dealers, who were much calmer, affected to joke at these counter-jumpers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.357#who wanted to meddle with such articles as chairs and tables; but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.358#customers were already leaving them, the success of the department had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.359#every appearance of being a formidable one. It was all over, they were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.360#obliged to bow their heads. After these others would be swept off, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.361#there was no reason why every business should not be driven away. One
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.362#day The Ladies' Paradise alone would cover the neighbourhood with its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.363#roof.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.364#At present, morning and evening, when the thousand employees went in and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.365#came out, they formed such a long procession in the Place Gaillon that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.366#people stopped to look at them as they would at a passing regiment.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.367#For ten minutes they blocked up all the streets; and the shopkeepers at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.368#their doors thought bitterly of their single assistant, whom they hardly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.369#knew how to find food for. The last balance-sheet of the big shop,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.370#the forty millions turned over, had also caused a revolution in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.371#neighbourhood. The figure passed from house to house amid cries of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.372#surprise and anger. Forty millions! Think of that! No doubt the net
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.373#profit did not exceed more than four per cent., with their heavy general
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.374#expenses, and system of low prices; but sixteen hundred thousand francs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.375#was a jolly sum, one could be satisfied with four per cent., when one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.376#operated on such a scale as that. It was said that Mouret's starting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.377#capital of five hundred thousand francs, augmented each year by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.378#total profits, a capital which must at that moment have amounted to four
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.379#millions, had thus passed ten times over the counters in the form of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.380#goods. Robineau, when he made this calculation before Denise, after
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.381#dinner, was overcome for a moment, his eyes fixed on his empty plate.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.382#She was right, it was this incessant renewal of the capital that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.383#constituted the invincible force of the new system of business. Bourras
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.384#alone denied the facts, refusing to understand, superb and stupid as a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.385#mile-stone. A pack of thieves and nothing more! A lying set! Cheap-jacks
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.386#who would be picked up out of the gutter one fine morning!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.387#The Baudus, however, notwithstanding their wish not to change anything
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.388#in the way of The Old Elbeuf, tried to sustain the competition. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.389#customers no longer coming to them, they forced themselves to go to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.390#customers, through the agency of travellers. There was at that time, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.391#the Paris market, a traveller connected with all the great tailors,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.392#who saved the little cloth and flannel houses when he condescended to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.393#represent them. Naturally they all tried to get hold of him; he assumed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.394#the importance of a personage; and Baudu, having haggled with him, had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.395#the misfortune of seeing him come to terms with the Matignons, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.396#Rue Croix-des-Petits-Champs. One after the other, two other travellers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.397#robbed him; a third, an honest man, did no business. It was a slow
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.398#death, without any shock, a continual decrease of business, customers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.399#lost one by one. A day came when the bills fell very heavily. Up to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.400#that time they had lived on their former savings; but now they began to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.401#contract debts. In December, Baudu, terrified by the amount of the bills
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.402#he had accepted, resigned himself to a most cruel sacrifice: he sold his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.403#country-house at Rambouillet, a house which cost him a lot of money in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.404#continual repairs, and for which the tenants had not even paid the rent
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.405#when he decided to get rid of it. This sale killed the only dream of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.406#his life, his heart bled as for the loss of some dear one. And he had to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.407#sell for seventy thousand francs that which had cost him more than two
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.408#hundred thousand, considering himself fortunate to have met the Lhommes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.409#his neighbours, who were desirous of adding to their property. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.410#seventy thousand francs would keep the business going a little longer;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.411#for notwithstanding the repulses already encountered, the idea of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.412#struggling sprang up again; perhaps with great care they might conquer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.413#even now.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.414#The Sunday on which the Lhommes paid the money, they were good enough to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.415#dine at The Old Elbeuf. Madame Aurélie was the first to arrive; they had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.416#to wait for the cashier, who came late, scared by a whole afternoon's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.417#music; as for young Albert, he had accepted the invitation, but did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.418#put in an appearance. It was, moreover, a somewhat painful evening. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.419#Baudus, living without air in their narrow dining-room, suffered from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.420#the gust of wind brought in by the Lhommes, with their scattered family
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.421#and taste for a free existence. Geneviève, wounded by Madame Aurélie's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.422#imperial airs, did not open her mouth; whilst Colomban was admiring
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.423#her with a shiver, on reflecting that she reigned over Clara. Before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.424#retiring to rest, in the evening, Madame Baudu being already in bed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.425#Baudu walked about the room for a long time. It was a mild night,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.426#thawing and damp. Outside, notwithstanding the closed windows, and drawn
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.427#curtains, one could hear the machinery roaring on the opposite side of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.428#the way.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.429#“Do you know what I'm thinking of, Elisabeth?” said he at last “Well!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.430#these Lhommes may earn as much money as they like, I'd rather be in my
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.431#shoes than theirs. They get on well, it's true. The wife said, didn't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.432#she? that she had made nearly twenty thousand francs this year, and that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.433#has enabled her to take my poor house. Never mind! I've no longer the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.434#house, but I don't go playing music in one direction, whilst you are
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.435#gadding about in the other. No, look you, they can't be happy.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.436#He was still labouring under the grief of his sacrifice, nourishing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.437#a certain rancour against those people who had bought up his darling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.438#dream. When he came near the bed, he gesticulated, leaning over his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.439#wife; then, returning to the window, he stood silent for a minute,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.440#listening to the noise of the works. And he resumed his old accusations,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.441#his despairing complaints about the new times; nobody had ever seen such
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.442#things, a shop-assistant earning more than a tradesman, cashiers buying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.443#up the employers' property. Everything was going to the dogs; family
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.444#ties no longer existed, people lived at hôtels instead of eating their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.445#meals at home in a respectable manner. He ended by prophesying that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.446#young Albert would later on swallow up the Rambouillet property with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.447#lot of actresses.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.448#Madame Baudu listened to him, her head flat on the pillow, so pale that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.449#her face was the colour of the sheets. “They've paid you,” at length
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.450#said she, softly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.451#At this Baudu became dumb. He walked about for an instant with his eyes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.452#on the ground. Then he resumed: “They've paid me, 'tis true; and,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.453#after all, their money is as good as another's. It would be funny if we
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.454#revived the business with this money. Ah! if I were not so old and worn
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.455#out!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.456#A long silence ensued. The draper was full of vague projects. Suddenly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.457#his wife spoke again, her eyes fixed on the ceiling, without moving her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.458#head: “Have you noticed your daughter lately?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.459#“No,” replied he.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.460#“Well! she makes me rather anxious. She's getting pale, she seems to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.461#pining away.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.462#He stood before the bed, full of surprise. “Really! whatever for? If
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.463#she's ill she should say so. To-morrow we must send for the doctor.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.464#Madame Baudu still remained motionless. After a short time, she declared
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.465#with her meditative air: “This marriage with Colomban, I think it would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.466#be better to get it over.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.467#He looked at her, then began walking about again. Certain things came
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.468#back to his mind. Was it possible that his daughter was falling ill over
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.469#the shopman? Did she love him so much that she could not wait? Here was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.470#another misfortune! It worried him all the more from the fact that he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.471#himself had fixed ideas about this marriage. He could never consent to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.472#it in the present state of affairs. However, his anxiety softened him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.473#“Very good,” said he at last, “I'll speak to Colomban.” And without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.474#saying another word he continued his walk. Soon afterwards his wife
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.475#fell off to sleep, quite white, as if dead; but he still kept on walking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.476#about. Before getting into bed he drew aside the curtains and glanced
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.477#outside; on the other side of the street, the gaping windows of the old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.478#Hôtel Duvillard showed the workmen moving about in the dazzling glare of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.479#the electric light.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.480#The next morning Baudu took Colomban to the further end of the store,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.481#on the upper floor, having made up his mind over night what he should
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.482#say to him. “My boy,” said he “you know I've sold my property at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.483#Rambouillet. That will enable us to show good fight. But I should like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.484#beforehand to have a talk with you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.485#The young man, who seemed to dread the interview, waited with an awkward
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.486#air. His small eyes twinkled in his large face, and he stood there with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.487#his mouth open--a sign with him of profound agitation.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.488#“Just listen to me,” resumed the draper. “When old Hauchecorne left me
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.489#The Old Elbeuf, the house was prosperous; he himself had received it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.490#from old Finet in a satisfactory state. You know my ideas; I should
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.491#consider it wrong if I passed this family trust to my children in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.492#diminished state; and that's why I've always postponed your marriage
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.493#with Genevieve. Yes, I was obstinate; I hoped to bring back our former
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.494#prosperity; I wanted to hand you the books, saying: 'Look here! the year
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.495#I commenced we sold so much cloth, and this year, the year I retire, we
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.496#have sold ten thousand or twenty thousand francs' worth more.' In short,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.497#you understand, it was a vow I had made to myself, the very natural
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.498#desire I had to prove that the house had not lost anything in my hands.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.499#Otherwise it would seem to me I was robbing you.” His voice was stifled
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.500#with emotion. He blew his nose to recover a bit, and asked, “You don't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.501#say anything?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.502#But Colomban had nothing to say. He shook his head, and waited, more and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.503#more troubled, thinking he could guess what, the governor was aiming at.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.504#It was the marriage without further delay. How could he refuse? He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.505#would never have the strength. And the other girl, of whom he dreamed at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.506#night, devoured by such a flame that he frequently threw himself quite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.507#naked on the floor, in the fear of dying of it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.508#“Now,” continued Baudu, “there's a sum of money that may save us. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.509#situation becomes worse every day, and perhaps by making a supreme
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.510#effort----In short, I thought it right to warn you. We are going to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.511#venture our last stake. If we are beaten, why that will entirely ruin
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.512#us! But, my poor boy, your marriage must be again postponed, for I don't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.513#wish to throw you two all alone into the struggle. That would be too
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.514#cowardly, wouldn't it?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.515#Colomban, greatly relieved, had seated himself on a pile of swan-skin
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.516#flannel. His legs were still trembling. He was afraid of showing his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.517#joy, he held down his head, rolling his fingers on his knees.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.518#“You don't say anything?” repeated Baudu.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.519#No, he said nothing, he could find nothing to say. The draper then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.520#slowly continued: “I was sure this would grieve you. You must muster up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.521#courage. Pull yourself together a bit, don't let yourself be crushed in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.522#this way. Above all, understand my position. Can I hang such a weight on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.523#your neck? Instead of leaving you a good business, I should leave you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.524#a bankruptcy perhaps. No, it's only a scoundrel who would play such a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.525#trick! No doubt, I desire nothing but your happiness, but no one shall
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.526#ever make me, go against my conscience.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.527#And he went on for a long time in this way, swaying about in a maze of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.528#contradictions, like a man who would have liked to be understood at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.529#half a word and finds himself obliged to explain everything. As he had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.530#promised his daughter and the shop, strict probity forced him to deliver
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.531#both in good condition, without defects or debts. But he was tired, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.532#burden seemed to be too much for him, his stammering voice was one of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.533#supplication. He got more entangled than ever in his words, he was still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.534#expecting a sudden rally from Colomban, some heartfelt cry, which came
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.535#not.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.536#“I know,” murmured he, “that old men are wanting in ardour. With young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.537#ones, things light up. They are full of fire, it's natural. But, no, no,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.538#I can't, my word of honour! If I gave it up to you, you would blame me
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.539#later on.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.540#He stopped, trembling, and as the young man still kept his head down,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.541#he asked him for the third time, after a painful silence: “You don't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.542#say anything?” At last, but without looking at him, Colomban replied:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.543#“There's nothing to say. You are the master, you know better than all of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.544#us. As you wish it we'll wait, we'll try and be reasonable.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.545#It was all over. Baudu still hoped he was going to throw himself into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.546#his arms, exclaiming: “Father, do you take a rest, we'll fight in our
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.547#turn; give us the shop as it is, so that we may work a miracle and save
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.548#it! Then he looked at him, and was seized with shame, accusing himself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.549#of having wished to dupe his children. The deep-rooted maniacal honesty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.550#of the shopkeeper was awakened in him; it was this prudent fellow who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.551#was right, for in business there is no such thing as sentiment, it is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.552#only a question of figures.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.553#“Give me your hand, my boy,” said he in conclusion. “It's settled we
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.554#won't speak about the marriage for another year. One must think of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.555#business before everything.” That evening in their room when Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.556#Baudu questioned her husband as to the result of the conversation, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.557#result of the conversation, the latter had resumed his obstinate wish to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.558#fight in person to the bitter end. He gave Colomban high praise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.559#calling him a solid fellow, firm in his ideas, brought up with the best
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.560#principles, incapable, for instance, of joking with the customers like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.561#those puppies at The Paradise. No, he was honest, he belonged to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.562#the family, he didn't speculate on the business as though he were a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.563#stock-jobber.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.564#“Well, then, when's the marriage to take place?” asked Madame Baudu.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.565#“Later on,” replied he, “when I am able to keep to my promises.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.566#She made no gestures, she simply observed: “It will be our daughter's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.567#death.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.568#Baudu restrained himself, stirred up with anger. He was the one whom it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.569#would kill, if they continually upset him like this! Was it his fault?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.570#He loved his daughter--would lay down his life for her; but he could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.571#not make the business prosper when it obstinately refused to do so.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.572#Geneviève ought to have a little more sense, and wait patiently for a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.573#better balance-sheet The deuce! Colomban was there, no one would run
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.574#away with him!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.575#“It's incredible!” repeated he; “such a well-trained girl!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.576#Madame Baudu said no more. No doubt she had guessed Genevieve's jealous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.577#agony; but she did not dare to inform her husband. A singular womanly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.578#modesty always prevented her approaching certain tender, delicate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.579#subjects with him. When he saw her so silent, he turned his anger
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.580#against the people opposite, stretching his fists out in the air,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.581#towards the works, where they were setting up large iron girders, with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.582#great noise of hammers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.583#Denise had decided to return to The Ladies' Paradise, having understood
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.584#that the Robineaus, though forced to cut down their staff, did not like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.585#to dismiss her. To maintain their position, now, they were obliged to do
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.586#everything themselves. Gaujean, obstinate in his rancour, renewed their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.587#bills, even promised to find them funds; but they were frightened, they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.588#wanted to go in for economy and order. During a whole fortnight Denise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.589#had felt uneasy with them, and she had to speak first, saying she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.590#found a situation elsewhere. This was a great relief. Madame Robineau
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.591#embraced her, deeply affected, saying she should always miss her. Then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.592#when, in reply to a question, the young girl said she was going back to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.593#Mouret's, Robineau turned pale.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.594#“You are right!” he exclaimed violently.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.595#It was not so easy to tell the news to old Bourras. However, Denise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.596#had to give him notice, and she trembled, for she was full of gratitude
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.597#towards him. Bourras just at this time was in a continual fever of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.598#rage--full of invectives against the works going on next door. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.599#builder's carts blocked up his doorway; the picks tapped on his walls;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.600#everything in his place, the umbrellas and the sticks, danced about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.601#to the noise of the hammers. It seemed that the hovel, obstinately
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.602#remaining amid all these demolitions, was going to give way. But the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.603#worst of all was that the architect, in order to connect the existing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.604#shops with those about to be opened in the Hôtel Duvillard, had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.605#conceived the idea of boring a passage under the little house that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.606#separated them. This house belonged to the firm of Mouret & Co., and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.607#the lease stipulating that the tenant should submit to all necessary
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.608#repairs, the workmen appeared on the scene one morning. At this Bourras
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.609#nearly went into a fit. Wasn't it enough to strangle him on all sides,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.610#on the right, the left, and behind, without attacking him underfoot as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.611#well, taking the ground from under him! And he drove the masons
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.612#away, and went to law. Repairs, yes! but this was rather a work of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.613#embellishment. The neighbourhood thought he would carry the day,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.614#without, however, being sure of anything The case, however, threatened
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.615#to be a long one, and people became very excited over this interminable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.616#duel. The day Denise resolved to give him notice, Bourras had just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.617#returned from his lawyer.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.618#“Would you believe it!” exclaimed he, “they now say the house is not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.619#solid; they pretend that the foundations must be strengthened. Confound
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.620#it! they have shaken it up so with their infernal machines, that it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.621#isn't astonishing if it gives way!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.622#Then, when the young girl announced she was going away, and that she was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.623#going back to The Ladies' Paradise at a salary of a thousand francs, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.624#was so amazed that he simply raised his trembling hands in the air. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.625#emotion made him drop into a chair.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.626#“You! you!” he stammered. “Ah, I'm the only one--I'm the only one left!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.627# After a pause, he asked: “And the youngster?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.628#“He'll go back to Madame Gras's,” replied Denise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.629#“She was very fond of him! that can't be refused. You'll all go. Go,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.630#then, leave me here alone. Yes, alone--you understand! There shall be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.631#one who will never bow his head. And tell them I'll win my lawsuit, if I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.632#have to sell my last shirt for it!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.633#Denise was not to leave Robineau's till the end of the month. She had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.634#seen Mouret again; everything was settled. One evening as she was going
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.635#up to her room, Deloche, who was watching for her in a doorway, stopped
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.636#her. He was delighted, having just heard the good news; they were all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.637#talking about it in the shop, he said. And he told her the gossip of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.638#counters.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.639#“You know, the young ladies in the dress department are pulling long
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.640#faces!” Then, interrupting himself, he added: “By the way, you remember
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.641#Clara Primaire? Well, it appears the governor has------ You understand?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.642#He had turned quite red. She, very pale, exclaimed: “Monsieur Mouret!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.643#“Funny taste--eh?” he resumed. “A woman who looks like a horse. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.644#little girl from the under-linen department, whom he had twice last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.645#year, was, at least, good-looking. However, that's his business.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.646#Denise, once upstairs, almost fainted away. It was surely through coming
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.647#up too quick. Leaning out of the window she had a sudden vision of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.648#Valognes, the deserted street and grassy pavement, which she used to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.649#see from her room as a child; and she was seized with a desire to go
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.650#and live there--to seek refuge in the peace and forgetfulness of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.651#country. Paris irritated her, she hated The Ladies' Paradise, she hardly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.652#knew why she had consented to go back. She would certainly suffer as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.653#much as ever there; she was already suffering from an unknown uneasiness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.654#since Deloche's stories. Suddenly, without any notice, a flood of tears
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.655#forced her to leave the window. She wept on for some time, and found
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.656#a little courage to live on still. The next day at breakfast-time, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.657#Robineau had sent her on an errand, and she was passing The Old Elbeuf,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.658#she pushed open the door on seeing Colomban alone in the shop. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.659#Baudus were breakfasting; she could hear the clatter of the knives and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.660#forks in the little room.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.661#“You can come in,” said the shopman. “They are at breakfast.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.662#But she motioned him to be silent, and drew him into a corner. Then,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.663#lowering her voice, she said: “It's you I want to speak to. Have you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.664#no heart? Don't you see that Geneviève loves you, and that it's killing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.665#her.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.666#She was trembling, the previous night's fever had taken possession
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.667#of her again. He, frightened, surprised at this sudden attack, stood
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.668#looking at her, without a word.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.669#“Do you hear?” she continued. “Genevieve knows you love another. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.670#told me so. She wept like a child. Ah, poor girl! she isn't very strong
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.671#now, I can tell you! If you had seen her thin arms! It's heart-breaking.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.672#You can't leave her to die like this!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.673#At last he spoke, quite overcome. “But she isn't ill--you exaggerate!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.674#I don't see anything myself. Besides, it's her father who is postponing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.675#the marriage.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.676#Denise sharply corrected this falsehood, certain that the least
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.677#persistence on the part of the young man would decide her uncle. As to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.678#Colomban's surprise, it was not feigned; he had really never noticed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.679#Genevieve's slow agony. For him it was a very disagreeable revelation;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.680#for while he remained ignorant of it, he had no great blame to tax
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.681#himself with.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.682#“And who for?” resumed Denise. “For a worthless girl! You can't know
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.683#who you are loving! Up to the present I have not wanted to hurt your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.684#feelings, I have often avoided answering your continual questions. Well!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.685#she goes with everybody, she laughs at you, you will never have her, or
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.686#you may have her, like others, just once in a way.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.687#He listened to her, very pale; and at each of the sentences she threw
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.688#into his face, his lips trembled. She, in a cruel fit, yielded to a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.689#transport of anger of which she had no consciousness. “In short,” said
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.690#she in a final cry, “she's with Monsieur Mouret, if you want to know!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.691#Her voice was stifled, she turned paler than Colomban himself. Both
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.692#stood looking at each other. Then he stammered out: “I love her!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.693#Denise felt ashamed of herself. Why was she talking in this way to this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.694#young fellow? Why was she getting so excited? She stood there mute, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.695#simple reply he had just given resounded in her heart like the clang of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.696#a bell, which deafened her. “I love her, I love her!” and it seemed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.697#to spread. He was right, he could not marry another woman. And as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.698#she turned round, she observed Genevieve on the threshold of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.699#dining-room.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.700#“Be quiet!” she said rapidly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.701#But it was too late, Genevieve must have heard, for her face was white
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.702#bloodless. Just at that moment a customer opened the door--Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.703#Bourdelais, one of the last faithful customers of the Old Elbeuf where
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.704#she found solid goods for her money; for a long time past Madame de
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.705#Boves had followed the fashion, and gone over to The Ladies' Paradise;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.706#Madame Marty herself no longer came, entirely captivated by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.707#seductions of the display opposite. And Genevieve was forced to go
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.708#forward, and say in her weak voice:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.709#“What do you desire, madame?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.710#Madame Bourdelais wished to sec some flannel. Colomban took down a roll
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.711#from a shelf. Genevieve showed the article; and both of them, their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.712#hands cold, found themselves brought together behind the counter.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.713#Meanwhile Baudu came out of the dining-room last, behind his wife, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.714#had gone and seated herself at the pay-desk. At first he did not meddle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.715#with the sale, but stood up, looking at Madame Bourdelais.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.716#“It is not good enough,” said the latter. “Show me the strongest you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.717#have.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.718#Colomban took down another bundle. There was a silence. Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.719#Bourdelais examined the stuff.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.720#“How much?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.721#“Six francs, madame,” replied Genevieve. The lady made an abrupt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.722#movement. “Six francs!” said she. “But they have the same opposite at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.723#five francs.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.724#A slight contraction passed over Baudu's face. He could not help
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.725#interfering politely. No doubt madame made a mistake, the stuff ought to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.726#have been sold at six francs and a half; it was impossible to give it at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.727#five francs. It must be another quality she was referring to.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.728#“No, no,” she repeated, with the obstinacy of a lady who could not be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.729#deceived. “The quality is the same. It may even be a little thicker.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.730#And the discussion got very warm. Baudu, his face getting bilious,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.731#made an effort to continue smiling. His bitterness against The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.732#Paradise was bursting in his throat.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.733#“Really,” said Madame Bourdelais at last, “you must treat me better,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.734#otherwise I shall go opposite, like the others.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.735#He then lost his head, and cried out, shaking with a passion he could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.736#not repress: “Well! go opposite!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.737#At this she got up, greatly annoyed, and went away without turning
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.738#round, saying: “That's what I am going to do, sir.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.739#A general stupor ensued. The governor's violence had frightened all of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.740#them. He was himself scared, and trembled at what he had just said. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.741#phrase had escaped against his will in the explosion of a long pent-up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.742#rancour. And the Baudus now stood there motionless, following Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.743#Bourdelais with their looks, watching her cross the street. She seemed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.744#to be carrying off their fortune. When she slowly passed under the high
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.745#door of The Ladies' Paradise, when they saw her disappear in the crowd,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.746#they felt a sort of sudden wrench.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.747#“There's another they've taken from us!” murmured the draper. Then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.748#turning towards Denise, of whose re-engagement he was aware, he said:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.749#“You as well, they've taken you back. Oh, I don't blame you for it. As
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.750#they have the money, they are naturally the strongest.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.751#Just then, Denise, still hoping that Geneviève had not overheard
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.752#Colomban, was saying to her: “He loves you. Try and cheer up.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.753#But the young girl replied to her in a very low and heartbroken voice:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.754#“Why do you tell me a falsehood? Look! he can't help it, he's always
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.755#glancing up there. I know very well they've stolen him from me, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.756#they've robbed us of everything else.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.757#Geneviève went and sat down on the seat at the desk near her mother. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.758#latter had doubtless guessed the fresh blow received by her daughter,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.759#for her anxious eyes wandered from her to Colomban, and then to The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.760#Ladies' Paradise. It was true, they had stolen everything from them:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.761#from the father, a fortune; from the mother, her dying child; from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.762#daughter, a husband, waited for for ten years. Before this condemned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.763#family, Denise, whose heart was overflowing with pity, felt for an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.764#instant afraid of being wicked. Was she not going to assist this machine
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.765#which was crushing the poor people? But she felt herself carried away as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.766#it were by an invisible force, and knew that she was doing no wrong.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.767#“Bah!” resumed Baudu, to give himself courage; “we sha'n't die over it,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.768#after all. For one customer lost we shall find two others. You hear,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.769#Denise, I've got over seventy thousand francs there, which will
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.770#certainly trouble your Mouret's rest. Come, come, you others, don't look
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.771#so glum!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.772#But he could not enliven them. He himself relapsed into a pale
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.773#consternation; and they all stood with their eyes on the monster,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.774#attracted, possessed, full of their misfortune. The work was nearly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.775#finished, the scaffolding had been removed from the front, a whole
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.776#side of the colossal edifice appeared, with its walls and large light
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.777#windows.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.778#Along the pavement at last open to circulation, stood eight vans that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.779#the messengers were loading one after the other.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.780#In the sunshine, a ray of which ran along the street, the green panels,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.781#picked out with red and yellow, sparkled like so many mirrors, sending
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.782#blinding reflections right into The Old Elbeuf. The drivers, dressed in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.783#black, of a correct appearance, were holding the horses well in, superb
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.784#pairs, shaking their silvered bits. And each time a van was loaded,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.785#there was a sonorous, rolling noise, which made the neighbouring small
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.786#shops tremble. And before this triumphal procession, which they were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.787#destined to submit to twice a day, the Baudus' hearts broke. The father
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.788#half fainted away, asking himself where this continual flood of goods
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.789#could go to; whilst the mother, tormented to death about her daughter,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:viii.790#continued to gaze into the street, her eyes drowned in a flood of tears.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1#CHAPTER IX.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.2#It was on a Monday, the 14th of March, that The Ladies' Paradise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.3#inaugurated its new buildings by a great exhibition of summer novelties,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.4#which was to last three days. Outside, a sharp wind was blowing, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.5#passers-by, surprised by this return of winter, spun along, buttoned up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.6#in their overcoats. However, behind the closed doors of the neighbouring
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.7#shops, quite an agitation was fermenting; and one could see, against the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.8#windows, the pale faces of the small tradesmen, occupied in counting the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.9#first carriages which stopped before the new grand entrance in the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.10#Neuve-Saint-Augustin. This door, lofty and deep like a church porch,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.11#surmounted by a group--Industry and Commerce hand-in-hand amidst a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.12#complication of symbols--was sheltered by a vast awning, the fresh
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.13#gilding of which seemed to light up the pavement with a ray of sunshine.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.14#To the right and left stretched the shop fronts, barely dry and of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.15#blinding whiteness, running along the Rue Monsigny and the Rue de
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.16#la Michodière, occupying the whole island, except on the Rue du
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.17#Dix-Décembre side, where the Crédit Immobilier intended to build.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.18#Along this barrack-like development, the small tradesmen, when they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.19#raised their heads, perceived the piles of goods through the large
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.20#plate-glass windows which, from the ground floor up to the second
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.21#storey, opened the house to the light of day. And this enormous cube,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.22#this colossal bazaar, shut out the sky from them, seeming to cause the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.23#cold which was making them shiver behind their frozen counters.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.24#As early as six o'clock, Mouret was on the spot, giving his final
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.25#orders. In the centre, starting from the grand entrance, a large gallery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.26#ran from end to end, flanked right and left by two narrower galleries,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.27#the Monsigny Gallery and the Michodière Gallery. The court-yards had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.28#been glazed and turned into halls, iron staircases rose from the ground
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.29#floor, iron bridges were thrown from one end to the other on the two
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.30#storeys. The architect, who happened to be a young man of talent with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.31#modern ideas, had only used stone for the under-ground floor and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.32#corner pillars, constructing the whole ground with the corner pillars,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.33#constructing the whole carcase of iron, the assemblage of beams and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.34#rafters being supported by columns. The arches of the flooring and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.35#partitions were of brickwork. Space had been gained everywhere, light
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.36#and air entered freely, and the public circulated with the greatest
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.37#ease under the bold flights of the far-stretching girders. It was the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.38#cathedral of modern commerce, light but solid, made for a nation of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.39#customers. Below, in the central gallery, after the door bargains, came
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.40#the cravat, the glove, and the silk departments; the Monsigny Gallery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.41#was occupied by the linen and the Rouen goods; the Michodière Gallery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.42#by the mercery, the hosiery, the drapery, and the woollen departments.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.43#Then, on the first floor were installed the ready-made, the under-linen,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.44#the shawl, the lace, and other new departments, whilst the bedding, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.45#carpets, the furnishing materials, all the cumbersome articles difficult
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.46#to handle, had been relegated to the second floor. The number of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.47#departments was now thirty-nine, with eighteen hundred employees, of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.48#whom two hundred were women. Quite a little world operated there, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.49#sonorous life of the high metallic naves.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.50#Mouret's unique passion was to conquer woman. He wished her to be queen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.51#in his house, and he had built this temple to get her completely at his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.52#mercy. His sole aim was to intoxicate her with gallant attentions, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.53#traffic on her desires, work on her fever. Night and day he racked his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.54#brain to invent fresh attractions. He had already introduced two lifts
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.55#lined with velvet for the upper storeys, in order to spare delicate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.56#ladies the trouble of mounting the stairs. Then he had just opened a bar
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.57#where the customers could find, gratis, some light refreshment, syrups
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.58#and biscuits, and a reading-room, a monumental gallery, decorated with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.59#excessive luxury, in which he had even ventured on an exhibition of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.60#pictures. But his most profound idea was to conquer the mother through
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.61#the child, when unable to do so through her coquetry; he neglected no
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.62#means, speculated on every sentiment, created departments for little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.63#boys and girls, arresting the passing mothers by distributing pictures
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.64#and air-balls to the children. A stroke of genius this idea of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.65#distributing to each buyer a red air-ball made of fine gutta-percha,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.66#bearing in large letters the name of the shop, and which, held by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.67#a string, floated in the air, parading in the streets a living
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.68#advertisement.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.69#But the greatest power of all was the advertising. Mouret spent three
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.70#hundred thousand francs a year in catalogues, advertisements, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.71#bills. For his summer sale he had launched forth two hundred thousand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.72#catalogues, of which fifty thousand went abroad, translated into every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.73#language. He now had them illustrated with engravings, even accompanying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.74#them with samples, gummed between the leaves. It was an overflowing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.75#display; The Ladies' Paradise became a household word all over the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.76#world, invading the walls, the newspapers, and even the curtains at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.77#theatres. He declared that woman was powerless against advertising, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.78#she was bound to follow the crowd. Not only that, he laid still more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.79#seductive traps for her, analysing her like a great moralist. Thus he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.80#had discovered that she could not resist a bargain, that she bought
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.81#without necessity when she thought she saw a cheap line, and on this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.82#observation he based his system of reductions in price, progressively
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.83#lowering the price of unsold articles, preferring to sell them at a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.84#loss, faithful to his principle of the continual renewal of the goods.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.85#He had penetrated still further into the heart of woman, and had just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.86#thought of the “returns,” a masterpiece of Jesuitical seduction. “Take
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.87#whatever you like, madame; you can return the article if you don't like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.88#it.” And the woman who hesitated was provided with the last excuse, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.89#possibility of repairing an extravagant folly, she took the article with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.90#an easy conscience. The returns and the reduction of prices now formed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.91#part of the classical working of the new style of business.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.92#But where Mouret revealed himself as an unrivalled master was in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.93#interior arrangement of the shops. He laid down as a law that not a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.94#corner of The Ladies' Paradise ought to remain deserted, requiring
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.95#everywhere a noise, a crowd, evidence of life; for life, said he,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.96#attracts life, increases and multiplies. From this law he drew all sorts
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.97#of applications. In the first place, there ought always to be a crush at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.98#the entrance, so that the people in the street should mistake it for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.99#a riot; and he obtained this crush by placing a lot of bargains at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.100#doors, shelves and baskets overflowing with very low-priced articles;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.101#so that the common people crowded there, stopping up the doorway, making
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.102#the shop look as if it were crammed with customers, when it was often
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.103#only half full. Then, in the galleries, he had the art of concealing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.104#the departments in which business was slack; for instance, the shawl
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.105#department in summer, and the printed calico department in winter, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.106#surrounded them with busy departments, drowning them with a continual
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.107#uproar. It was he alone who had been inspired with the idea of placing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.108#on the second-floor the carpet and furniture counters, counters where
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.109#the customers were less frequent, and which if placed on the ground
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.110#floor would have caused empty, cold spaces. If he could have managed it,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.111#he would have had the street running through his shop.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.112#Just at that moment, Mouret was a prey to an attack of inspiration. On
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.113#the Saturday evening, as he was giving a last look at the preparations
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.114#for the Monday's great sale, he was suddenly struck with the idea that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.115#the arrangement of the departments adopted by him was wrong and stupid;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.116#and yet It seemed a perfectly logical arrangement: the stuffs on one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.117#side, the made-up articles on the other, an intelligent order of things
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.118#which would enable the customers to find their way themselves. He had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.119#thought of this orderly arrangement formerly, in Madame Hédouin's narrow
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.120#shop; and now he felt his faith shaken, just as he carried out his idea.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.121#Suddenly he cried out that they would “have to alter all that.” They had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.122#forty-eight hours, and half what had been done had to be changed. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.123#staff, frightened, bewildered, had been obliged to work two nights and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.124#the entire Sunday, amidst a frightful disorder. On the Monday morning
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.125#even, an hour before the opening, there was still some goods to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.126#placed. Decidedly the governor was going mad, no one understood, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.127#general consternation prevailed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.128#[Illustration: 0355]
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.129#“Come, look sharp!” cried Mouret, with the quiet assurance of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.130#genius. “There are some more costumes to be taken upstairs. And the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.131#Japan goods, are they placed on the central landing? A last effort, my
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.132#boys, you'll see the sale by-and-by.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.133#Bourdoncle had also been there since daybreak. He did not understand any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.134#more than the others, and he followed the governor's movements with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.135#an anxious eye. He hardly dared to ask him any questions, knowing how
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.136#Mouret received people in these critical moments. However, he at last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.137#made up his mind, and gently asked: “Was it really necessary to upset
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.138#everything like that, on the eve of our sale?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.139#At first Mouret shrugged his shoulders without replying. Then as the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.140#other persisted, he burst out: “So that all the customers should heap
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.141#themselves into one corner--eh? A nice idea of mine! I should never have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.142#got over it! Don't you see that it would have localised the crowd. A
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.143#woman would have come in, gone straight to the department she wished,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.144#passed from the petticoat counter to the dress one, from the dress to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.145#the mantle, then retired, without having even lost herself for a moment?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.146#Not one would have thoroughly seen the establishment!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.147#“But,” remarked Bourdoncle, “now that you have disarranged everything,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.148#and thrown the goods all over the place, the employees will wear out
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.149#their legs in guiding the customers from department to department.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.150#Mouret gave a look of superb contempt. “I don't care a hang for that!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.151#They're young, it'll make them grow! So much the better if they do walk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.152#about! They'll appear more numerous, and increase the crowd. The greater
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.153#the crush the better; all will go well!” He laughed, and deigned to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.154#explain his idea, lowering his voice: “Look here, Bourdoncle, listen to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.155#the result. Firstly, this continual circulation of customers disperses
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.156#them all over the shop, multiplies them, and makes them lose their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.157#heads; secondly, as they must be conducted from one end of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.158#establishment to the other, if they want, for instance, a lining after
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.159#having bought a dress, these journeys in every direction triple the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.160#size of the house in their eyes; thirdly, they are forced to traverse
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.161#departments where they would never have set foot otherwise, temptations
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.162#present themselves on their passage, and they succumb; fourthly----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.163#Bourdoncle was now laughing with him. At this Mouret, delighted, stopped
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.164#to call out to the messengers: “Very good, my boys! now for a sweep, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.165#it'll be splendid!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.166#But on turning round he perceived Denise. He and Bourdoncle were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.167#opposite the ready-made department, which he had just dismembered by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.168#sending the dresses and costumes up on the second-floor at the other
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.169#end of the building. Denise, the first down, was opening her eyes with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.170#astonishment, quite bewildered by the new arrangements.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.171#“What is it?” murmured she; “are we going to move?” This surprise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.172#appeared to amuse Mouret, who adored these sensational effects. Early in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.173#February Denise had returned to The Ladies' Paradise, where she had been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.174#agreeably surprised to find the staff polite, almost respectful. Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.175#Aurélie especially was very kind; Marguerite and Clara seemed resigned;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.176#even down to old Jouve, who also bowed his head, with an awkward
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.177#embarrassed air, as if desirous of effacing the disagreeable memory of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.178#the past. It sufficed that Mouret had said a few words, everybody
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.179#was whispering, following her with their eyes. And in this general
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.180#amiability, the only things that wounded her were Deloche's singularly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.181#melancholy looks, and Paulines inexplicable smiles. However, Mouret was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.182#still looking at her in his delighted way.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.183#“What is it you want, mademoiselle?” asked he at last.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.184#Denise had noticed him. She blushed slightly. Since her return she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.185#received marks of kindness from him which greatly touched her. Pauline,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.186#without her knowing why, had given her a full account of the governor's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.187#and Clara's love affairs: where he saw her, and what he paid her; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.188#she often returned to the subject, even adding that he had another
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.189#mistress, that Madame Desforges, well known by all the shop. Such
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.190#stories stirred up Denise, she felt in his presence all her former
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.191#fears, an uneasiness in which her gratitude was struggling against her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.192#anger.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.193#“It's all this confusion going on in the place,” she murmured.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.194#Mouret then approached her and said in a lower voice:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.195#“Have the goodness to come to my office this evening after business. I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.196#wish to speak to you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.197#Greatly agitated, she bowed her head without saying a word. And she went
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.198#into the department where the other saleswomen were now arriving. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.199#Bourdoncle had overheard Mouret, and he looked at him with a smile. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.200#even ventured to say when they were alone:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.201#“That girl again! Be careful; it will end by being serious!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.202#Mouret hastily defended himself, concealing his emotion beneath an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.203#air of superior indifference. “Never fear, it's only a joke! The woman
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.204#who'll catch me isn't born, my dear fellow!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.205#And as the shop was opening at last, he rushed off to give a final look
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.206#at the various counters. Bourdoncle shook his head. This Denise, so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.207#simple and quiet, began to make him uneasy. The first time, he had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.208#conquered by a brutal dismissal. But she had reappeared, and he felt she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.209#had become so strong that he now treated her as a redoubtable adversary,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.210#remaining mute before her, patiently waiting. Mouret, whom he caught up,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.211#was shouting out downstairs, in the Saint-Augustin Hall, opposite the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.212#entrance door:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.213#“Are you playing with me? I ordered the blue parasols to be put as a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.214#border. Just pull all that down, and be quick about it!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.215#He would listen to nothing; a gang of messengers had to come and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.216#re-arrange the exhibition of parasols. Seeing the customers arriving, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.217#even had the doors closed for a moment, declaring that he would not open
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.218#them, rather than have the blue parasols in the centre. It ruined his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.219#composition. The renowned dressers, Hutin, Mignot, and others, came to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.220#look, and opened their eyes; but they affected not to understand, being
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.221#of a different school.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.222#At last the doors were opened again, and the crowd flowed in. From the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.223#first, before the shop was full, there was such a crush at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.224#doorway that they were obliged to call the police to re-establish the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.225#circulation on the pavement. Mouret had calculated correctly; all the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.226#housekeepers, a compact troop of middle-class women and workmen's wives,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.227#swarmed around the bargains and remnants displayed in the open street.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.228#They felt the “hung” goods at the entrance; a calico at seven sous,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.229#a wool and cotton grey stuff at nine sous, and, above all, an Orleans
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.230#cloth at seven sous and half, which was emptying the poorer purses.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.231#There was an elbowing, a feverish crushing around the shelves and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.232#baskets containing the articles at reduced prices, lace at two sous,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.233#ribbon at five, garters at three the pair, gloves, petticoats, cravats,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.234#cotton socks, and stockings, were all tumbled about, and disappearing,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.235#as if swallowed up by the voracious crowd. Notwithstanding the cold, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.236#shopmen who were selling in the open street could not serve fast enough.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.237#A woman in the family way cried out with pain; two little girls were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.238#nearly stifled.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.239#All the morning this crush went on increasing. Towards one o'clock there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.240#was a crowd waiting to enter; the street was blocked as in a time of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.241#riot. Just at that moment, as Madame de Boves and her daughter Blanche
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.242#were standing on the pavement opposite, hesitating, they were accosted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.243#by Madame Marty, also accompanied by her daughter Valentine.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.244#“What a crowd--eh?” said the former. “They're killing themselves inside.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.245#I ought not to have come, I was in bed, but got up to get a little fresh
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.246#air.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.247#“Just like me,” said the other. “I promised my husband to go and see his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.248#sister at Montmartre. Then just as I was passing, I thought of a piece
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.249#of braid I wanted. I may as well buy it here as anywhere else, mayn't I?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.250#Oh, I sha'n't spend a sou! in fact I don't want anything.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.251#However, they did not take their eyes off the door, seized and carried
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.252#away as it were by the force of the crowd.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.253#“No, no, I'm not going in, I'm afraid,” murmured Madame de Boves.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.254#“Blanche, let's go away, we should be crushed.” But her voice failed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.255#she was gradually yielding to the desire to follow the others; and her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.256#fear dissolved in the irresistible attraction of the crush. Madame Marty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.257#was also giving way, repeating:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.258#“Keep hold of my dress, Valentine. Ah, well! I've never seen such a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.259#thing before. You are lifted off your feet. What will it be like inside?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.260#The ladies, seized by the current, could not now go back. As streams
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.261#attract to themselves the fugitive waters of a valley, so it seemed that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.262#the wave of customers, flowing into the vestibule, was absorbing the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.263#passers-by, drinking in the population from the four corners of Paris.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.264#They advanced but slowly, squeezed almost to death, kept upright by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.265#shoulders and bellies around them, of which they felt the close heat;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.266#and their satisfied desire enjoyed the painful entrance which incited
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.267#still further their curiosity. There was a pell-mell of ladies arrayed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.268#in silk, of poorly dressed middle-class women, and of bare-headed girls,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.269#all excited and carried away by the same passion. A few men buried
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.270#beneath the overflow of bosoms were casting anxious glances around them.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.271#A nurse, in the thickest of the crowd, held her baby above her head, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.272#youngster crowing with delight. The only one to get angry was a skinny
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.273#woman, who broke out into bad words, accusing her neighbour of digging
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.274#right into her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.275#“I really think I shall lose my skirts in this crowd,” remarked Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.276#de Boves.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.277#Mute, her face still fresh from the open air, Madame Marty was standing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.278#on tip-toe to see above the others' heads into the depths of the shop.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.279#The pupils of her grey eyes were as contracted as those of a cat coming
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.280#out of the broad daylight; she had the reposed flesh, and the clear
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.281#expression of a person just waking up.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.282#“Ah, at last!” said she, heaving a sigh.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.283#The ladies had just extricated themselves. They were in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.284#Saint-Augustin Hall, which they were greatly surprised to find almost
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.285#empty. But a feeling of comfort invaded them, they seemed to be entering
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.286#into spring-time after emerging from the winter of the street. Whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.287#outside, the frozen wind, laden with rain and hail, was still blowing,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.288#the fine season, in The Paradise galleries, was already budding forth
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.289#with the light stuffs, the flowery brilliancy of the tender shades, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.290#rural gaiety of the summer dresses and the parasols.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.291#“Do look there!” exclaimed Madame de Boves, standing motionless, her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.292#eyes in the air.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.293#It was the exhibition of parasols. Wide-open, rounded off like shields,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.294#they covered the whole hall, from the glazed roof to the varnished oak
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.295#mouldings below. They described festoons round the semi-circular arches
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.296#of the upper storeys; they descended in garlands along the slender
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.297#columns; they ran along in close lines on the balustrades of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.298#galleries and the staircases; and everywhere, ranged symmetrically,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.299#speckling the walls with red, green, and yellow, they looked like great
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.300#Venetian lanterns, lighted up for some colossal entertainment. In the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.301#corners were more complicated patterns, stars composed of parasols at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.302#thirty-nine sous, the light shades of which, pale-blue, cream-white, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.303#blush rose, seemed to burn with the sweetness of a night-light; whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.304#up above, immense Japanese parasols, on which golden-coloured cranes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.305#soared in a purple sky, blazed forth with the reflections of a great
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.306#conflagration.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.307#Madame Marty endeavoured to find a phrase to express her rapture, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.308#could only exclaim, “It's like fairyland!” Then trying to find out
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.309#where she was she continued: “Let's see, the braid is in the mercery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.310#department. I shall buy my braid and be off.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.311#“I will go with you,” said Madame de Boves. “Eh? Blanche, we'll just go
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.312#through the shop, nothing more.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.313#But they had hardly left the door before they lost themselves. They
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.314#turned to the left, and as the mercery department had been moved, they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.315#dropped right into the middle of the one devoted to collarettes, cuffs,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.316#trimmings, &c. It was very warm under the galleries, a hot-house heat,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.317#moist and close, laden with the insipid odour of the stuffs, and in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.318#which the stamping of the crowd was stifled. They then returned to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.319#door, where an outward current was already established, an interminable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.320#line of women and children, over whom floated a multitude of red
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.321#air-balls. Forty thousand of these were ready; there were men specially
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.322#placed for their distribution. To see the customers who were going out,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.323#one would have thought there was a flight of enormous soap-bubbles above
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.324#them, at the end of the almost invisible strings, reflecting the fiery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.325#glare of the parasols. The whole place was illuminated by them.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.326#“There's quite a world here!” declared Madame de Boves. “You hardly know
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.327#where you are.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.328#However, the ladies could not remain in the eddy of the door, right in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.329#the crush of the entrance and exit. Fortunately, Jouve, the inspector,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.330#came to their assistance. He stood in the vestibule, grave, attentive,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.331#eyeing each woman as she passed. Specially charged with the inside
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.332#police, he was on the lookout for thieves, and especially followed women
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.333#in the family way, when the fever of their eyes became too alarming.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.334#“The mercery department, ladies?” said he obligingly, “turn to the left;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.335#look! just there behind the hosiery department.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.336#Madame de Boves thanked him. But Madame Marty, turning round, no
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.337#longer saw her daughter Valentine beside her. She was beginning to feel
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.338#frightened, when she caught sight of her, already a long way off, at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.339#end of the Saint-Augustin Hall, deeply absorbed before a table covered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.340#with a heap of women's cravats at nineteen sous. Mouret practised the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.341#system of offering articles to the customers, hooking and plundering
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.342#them as they passed; for he used every sort of advertisement, laughing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.343#at the discretion of certain fellow-tradesmen who thought the articles
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.344#should be left to speak for themselves. Special salesmen, idle and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.345#smooth-tongued Parisians, thus got rid of considerable quantities of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.346#small trashy things.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.347#“Oh, mamma!” murmured Valentine, “just look at these cravats. They have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.348#a bird embroidered at the corners.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.349#The shopman cracked up the article, swore it was all silk, that the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.350#manufacturer had become bankrupt, and that they would never have such a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.351#bargain again.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.352#“Nineteen sous--is it possible?” said Madame Marty, tempted as well as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.353#her daughter. “Well! I can take a couple, that won't ruin us.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.354#Madame de Boves disdained this style of thing, she detested things
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.355#being offered. A shopman calling her made her run away. Madame Marty,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.356#surprised, could not understand this nervous horror of commercial
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.357#quackery, for she was of another nature; she was one of those fortunate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.358#women who delight in being thus violated, in bathing in the caress of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.359#this public offering, with the enjoyment of plunging one's hands in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.360#everything, and wasting one's time in useless talk.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.361#“Now,” she said, “I'm going for my braid. I don't wish to see anything
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.362#else.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.363#However, as she crossed the cravat and glove departments, her heart once
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.364#more failed her. There was, under the diffuse light, a display made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.365#up of bright and gay colours, which produced a ravishing effect The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.366#counters, symmetrically arranged, seemed like so many flower-borders,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.367#changing the hall into a French garden, in which smiled a tender gamut
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.368#of blossoms. Lying on the bare wood, in open boxes, and protruding from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.369#the overflowing drawers, a quantity of silk hand-kerchiefs displayed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.370#the bright scarlet of the geranium, the creamy white of the petunia,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.371#the golden yellow of the chrysanthemum, the sky-blue of the verbena; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.372#higher up, on brass stems, twined another florescence, fichus carelessly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.373#hung, ribbons unrolled, quite a brilliant cordon, which extended along,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.374#climbed up the columns, and were multiplied indefinitely by the mirrors.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.375#But what most attracted the crowd was a Swiss cottage in the glove
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.376#department, made entirely of gloves, a chef d'ouvre of Mignot's, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.377#had taken him two days to arrange. In the first place, the ground-floor
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.378#was composed of black gloves; then came straw-coloured, mignonette,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.379#and red gloves, distributed in the decoration, bordering the windows,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.380#forming the balconies, and taking the place of the tiles.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.381#“What do you desire, madame?” asked Mignot, on seeing Madame Marty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.382#planted before the cottage. “Here are some Swedish kid gloves at one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.383#franc fifteen sous, first quality.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.384#He offered his wares with furious energy, calling the passing customers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.385#from the end of his counter, dunning them with his politeness. As she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.386#shook her head in refusal he confined: “Tyrolian gloves, one franc five
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.387#sous. Turin gloves for children, embroidered gloves in all colours.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.388#“No, thanks; I don't want anything,” declared Madame Marty.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.389#But feeling that her voice was softening, he attacked her with greater
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.390#energy than ever, holding the embroidered gloves before her eyes; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.391#she could not resist, she bought a pair. Then, as Madame de Boves looked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.392#at her with a smile, she blushed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.393#“Don't you think me childish--eh? If I don't make haste and get my braid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.394#and be off, I shall be done for.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.395#Unfortunately, there was such a crush in the mercery department that she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.396#could not get served. They had both been waiting for over ten minutes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.397#and were getting annoyed, when the sudden meeting with Madame Bourdelais
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.398#occupied their attention. The latter explained, with her quiet practical
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.399#air, that she had just brought the little ones to see the show.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.400#Madeleine was ten, Edmond eight, and Lucien four years old; and they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.401#were laughing with joy, it was a cheap treat long promised.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.402#“They are really too comical; I shall buy a red parasol,” said Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.403#Marty all at once, stamping with impatience at being there doing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.404#nothing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.405#She choose one at fourteen francs and a-half. Madame Bourdelais, after
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.406#having watched the purchase with a look of blame, said to her amicably:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.407#“You are very wrong to be in such a hurry. In a month's time you could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.408#have had it for ten francs. They won't catch me like that.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.409#And she developed quite a theory of careful housekeeping. As the shops
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.410#lowered their prices, it was simply a question of waiting. She did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.411#wish to be taken in by them, so she preferred to take advantage of their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.412#real bargains. She even showed a feeling of malice in the struggle,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.413#boasting that she had never left them a sou profit.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.414#“Come,” said she at last, “I've promised my little ones to show them the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.415#pictures upstairs in the reading-room. Come up with us, you have plenty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.416#of time.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.417#And the braid was forgotten. Madame Marty yielded at once, whilst Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.418#de Boves refused, preferring to take a turn on the ground-floor first.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.419#Besides, they were sure to meet again upstairs. Madame Bourdelais was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.420#looking for a staircase when she perceived one of the lifts; and she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.421#pushed her children in to complete their pleasure. Madame Marty and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.422#Valentine also entered the narrow cage, where they were closely packed;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.423#but the mirrors, the velvet seats, and the polished brasswork took up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.424#their attention so much that they arrived at the first storey without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.425#having felt the gentle ascent of the machine. Another pleasure was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.426#in store for them, in the first gallery. As they passed before the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.427#refreshment bar, Madame Bourdelais did not fail to gorge her little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.428#family with syrup. It was a square room with a large marble counter;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.429#at the two ends there were silvered fountains from which flowed a small
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.430#stream of water; whilst rows of bottles stood on small shelves behind.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.431#Three waiters were continually engaged wiping and filling the glasses.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.432#To restrain the thirsty crowd, they had been obliged to establish a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.433#system of turns, as at theatres and railway-stations, by erecting a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.434#barrier covered with velvet. The crush was terrific. Some people, losing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.435#all shame before these gratuitous treats, made themselves ill.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.436#“Well! where are they?” exclaimed Madame Bourdelais when she extricated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.437#herself from the crowd, after having wiped the children's faces with her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.438#handkerchief.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.439#But she caught sight of Madame Marty and Valentine at the further end
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.440#of another gallery, a long way off. Both buried beneath a heap of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.441#petticoats, were still buying. They were conquered, the mother and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.442#daughter were rapidly disappearing in the fever of spending which was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.443#carrying them away. When she at last arrived in the reading-room Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.444#Bourdelais installed Madeleine, Edmond, and Lucien before the large
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.445#table; then taking from one of the shelves some photographic albums she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.446#brought them to them. The ceiling of the long apartment was covered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.447#with gold; at the two extremities, monumental chimney-pieces faced each
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.448#other; some rather poor pictures, very richly framed, covered the walls;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.449#and between the columns before each of the arched bays opening into the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.450#various shops, were tall green plants in majolica vases. Quite a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.451#silent crowd surrounded the table, which was littered with reviews and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.452#newspapers, with here and there some ink-stands and boxes of stationery.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.453#Ladies took off their gloves, and wrote their letters on the paper
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.454#stamped with the name of the house, which they crossed out with a dash
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.455#of the pen. A few men, lolling back in the armchairs, were reading the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.456#newspapers. But a great many people sat there doing nothing: husbands
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.457#waiting for their wives, let loose in the various departments, discreet
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.458#young women looking out for their lovers, old relations left there as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.459#in a cloak-room, to be taken away when time to leave. And this little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.460#society, comfortably installed, quietly reposed itself there, glancing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.461#through the open bays into the depths of the galleries and the halls,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.462#from which a distant murmur ascended above the grating of the pens and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.463#the rustling of the newspapers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.464#“What! you here!” said Madame Bourdelais. “I didn't know you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.465#Near the children was a lady concealed behind the pages of a review.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.466#It was Madame Guibal She seemed annoyed at the meeting; but quickly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.467#recovering herself, related that she had come to sit down for a moment
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.468#to escape the crush. And as Madame Bourdelais asked her if she was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.469#going to make any purchases, she replied with her languorous air, hiding
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.470#behind her eyelashes the egoistical greediness of her looks:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.471#“Oh! no. On the contrary, I have come to return some goods. Yes, some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.472#door-curtains which I don't like. But there is such a crowd that I am
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.473#waiting to get near the department.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.474#She went on talking, saying how convenient this system of returns
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.475#was; formerly she never bought anything, but now she sometimes allowed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.476#herself to be tempted. In fact, she returned four articles out of five,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.477#and was getting known at all the counters for her strange system
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.478#of buying, and her eternal discontent which made her bring back the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.479#articles one by one, after having kept them several days. But, whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.480#speaking, she did not take her eyes off the doors of the reading-room;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.481#and she appeared greatly relieved when Madame Bourdelais rejoined her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.482#children, to explain the photographs to them. Almost at the same
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.483#moment Monsieur de Boves and Paul de Vallagnosc came in. The count,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.484#who affected to be showing the young man through the new buildings,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.485#exchanged a rapid glance with Madame Guibal; and she then plunged into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.486#her review again, as if she had not seen him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.487#“Hullo, Paul!” suddenly exclaimed a voice behind these gentlemen.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.488#It was Mouret, on his way round to give a look at the various
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.489#departments. They shook hands, and he at once asked: “Has Madame de
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.490#Boves done us the honour of coming?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.491#“Well, no,” replied the husband, “and she very much regrets it. She's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.492#not very well. Oh! nothing dangerous!” But suddenly he pretended to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.493#catch sight of Madame Guibal, and ran off, going up to her bareheaded,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.494#whilst the others merely bowed to her from a distance. She also
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.495#pretended to be surprised. Paul smiled; he now understood the affair,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.496#and he related to Mouret in a low voice how De Boves, whom he had met in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.497#the Rue Richelieu, had tried to get away from him, and had finished by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.498#dragging him into The Ladies' Paradise, under the pretext that he must
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.499#show him the new buildings. For the last year the lady had drawn from De
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.500#Boves all the money and pleasure she could, never writing to him, making
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.501#appointments with him in public places, churches, museums, and shops, to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.502#arrange their affairs.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.503#“I fancy that at each meeting they change their hôtel,” murmured the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.504#young man. “Not long ago, he was on a tour of inspection; he wrote to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.505#his wife every day from Blois, Libourne, and Tarbes; and yet I feel
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.506#convinced I saw them going into a family boarding-house at Batignolles.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.507#But look at him, isn't he splendid before her with his military
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.508#correctness! The old French gallantry, my dear fellow, the old French
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.509#gallantry!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.510#“And your marriage?” asked Mouret Paul, without taking his eyes off the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.511#count, replied that they were still waiting for the death of the aunt.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.512#Then, with a triumphant air: “There, did you see him? He stooped down,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.513#and slipped an address into her hand. She's now accepting with the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.514#virtuous air. She's a terrible woman, that delicate red-haired creature
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.515#with her careless ways. Well! there are some fine things going on in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.516#your place!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.517#“Oh!” said Mouret, smiling, “these ladies are not in my house, they are
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.518#at home here.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.519#He then began to joke. Love, like the swallows, always brought good luck
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.520#to a house. No doubt he knew the girls who wandered about from counter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.521#to counter, the ladies who accidentally met a friend in the shop; but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.522#if they bought nothing, they filled up a place, and helped to crowd and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.523#warm the shop. Still continuing his gossip, he carried his old comrade
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.524#off, and planted him on the threshold of the reading-room, opposite the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.525#grand central gallery, the successive halls of which ran along at their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.526#feet. Behind them, the reading-room still retained its quiet air,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.527#only disturbed by the scratching of the pens and the rustling of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.528#newspapers. One old gentleman had gone to sleep over the _Moniteur_.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.529#Monsieur de Boves was looking at the pictures, with the evident
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.530#intention of losing his future son-in-law in the crowd as soon as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.531#possible. And, alone, amid this calmness, Madame Bourdelais was amusing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.532#her children, talking very loud, as in a conquered place.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.533#“You see they are quite at home,” said Mouret, who pointed with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.534#broad gesture to the multitude of women with which the departments were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.535#overflowing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.536#Just at that moment Madame Desforges, after having nearly had her mantle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.537#carried away in the crowd, at last came in and crossed the first hall.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.538#Then, on reaching the principal gallery, she raised her eyes. It was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.539#like a railway span, surrounded by the balustrades of the two storeys,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.540#intersected by hanging staircases, crossed by flying bridges. The iron
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.541#staircases developed bold curves, multiplying the landings; the iron
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.542#bridges suspended in space, ran straight along, very high up; and all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.543#this iron formed, beneath the white light of the windows, an excessively
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.544#light architecture, a complicated lace-work through which the daylight
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.545#penetrated, the modern realisation of a dreamed-of palace, of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.546#Babel-like heaping up of the storeys, enlarging the rooms, opening up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.547#glimpses on to other floors and into other rooms without end. In fact,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.548#iron reigned everywhere; the young architect had had the honesty and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.549#courage not to disguise it under a coating of paint imitating stone or
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.550#wood. Down below, in order not to outshine the goods, the decoration was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.551#sober, with large regular spaces in neutral tints; then as the metallic
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.552#work ascended, the capitals of the columns became richer, the rivets
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.553#formed ornaments, the shoulder-pieces and corbels were loaded with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.554#sculptured work; up above, there was a mass of painting, green and red,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.555#amidst a prodigality of gold, floods of gold, heaps of gold, even to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.556#the glazed-work, the glass of which was enamelled and inlaid with gold.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.557#Under the covered galleries, the bare brick-work of the arches was also
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.558#decorated in bright colours. Mosaics and earthenware also formed part
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.559#of the decoration, enlivening the friezes, lighting up with their fresh
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.560#notes the severity of the whole; whilst the stairs, with their red
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.561#velvet covered hand-rails, were edged with a band of curved polished
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.562#iron, which shone like the steel of a piece of armour.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.563#Although she had already seen the new establishment
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.564#Madame Desforges stood still, struck by the ardent life which was this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.565#day animating the immense nave. Below, around her, continued the eddying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.566#of the crowd, of which the double current of those entering and those
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.567#going out made itself felt as far as the silk department; a crowd still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.568#very mixed in its elements, though the afternoon was bringing a greater
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.569#number of ladies amongst the shopkeepers and house-wives; a great many
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.570#women in mourning, with their flowing veils, and the inevitable wet
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.571#nurses straying about, protecting their babies with their outstretched
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.572#arms. And this sea of faces, these many-coloured hats, these bare heads,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.573#both dark and light, rolled from one end of the gallery to the other,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.574#confused and discoloured amidst the loud glare of the stuffs. Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.575#Desforges could see nothing but large price tickets bearing enormous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.576#figures everywhere, their white patches standing out on the bright
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.577#printed cottons, the shining silks, and the sombre woollens. Piles of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.578#ribbons curtailed the heads, a wall of flannel threw out a promontory;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.579#on all sides the mirrors carried the departments back into infinite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.580#space, reflecting the displays with portions of the public, faces
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.581#reversed, and halves of shoulders and arms; whilst to the right and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.582#to the left the lateral galleries opened up other vistas, the snowy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.583#background of the linen department, the speckled depth of the hosiery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.584#one, distant views illuminated by the rays of light from some glazed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.585#bay, and in which the crowd appeared nothing but a mass of human
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.586#dust. Then, when Madame Desforges raised her eyes, she saw, along the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.587#staircases, on the flying bridges, around the balustrade of each storey,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.588#a continual humming ascent, an entire population in the air, travelling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.589#in the cuttings of the enormous ironwork construction, casting black
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.590#shadows on the diffused light of the enamelled windows. Large gilded
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.591#lustres hung from the ceiling; a decoration of rugs, embroidered silks,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.592#stuffs worked with gold, hung down, draping the balustrade with gorgeous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.593#banners; and, from one end to the other, there were clouds of lace,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.594#palpitations of muslin, trophies of silks, apotheoses of half-dressed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.595#dummies; and right at the top, above all this confusion, the bedding
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.596#department, suspended as it were, displayed little iron bedsteads with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.597#their mattresses, hung with their white curtains, a sort of school
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.598#dormitory sleeping amidst the stamping of the customers, rarer and rarer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.599#as the departments ascended.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.600#“Does madame require a cheap pair of garters?” asked a salesman of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.601#Madame Desforges, seeing her standing still “All silk, twenty-nine
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.602#sous.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.603#She did not deign to answer. Things were being offered around her more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.604#feverishly than ever. She wanted, however, to find out where she was.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.605#Albert Lhomme's pay-desk was on her left; he knew her by sight and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.606#ventured to give her an amiable smile, not in the least hurry in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.607#midst of the heaps of bills by which he was besieged; whilst, behind
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.608#him, Joseph, struggling with the string-box, could not pack up the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.609#articles fast enough. She then saw where she was; the silk department
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.610#must be in front of her. But it took her ten minutes to get there,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.611#the crowd was becoming so immense. Up in the air, at the end of their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.612#invisible strings, the red air-balls had become more numerous than ever;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.613#they now formed clouds of purple, gently blowing towards the doors,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.614#continuing to scatter themselves over Paris; and she had to bow her head
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.615#beneath the flight of air-balls, when very young children held them, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.616#string rolled round their little fingers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.617#“What! you have ventured here, madame?” exclaimed Bouthemont gaily, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.618#soon as he caught sight of Madame Desforges.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.619#The manager of the silk department, introduced to her by Mouret himself,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.620#was now in the habit of sometimes calling on her at her five o'clock
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.621#tea. She thought him common, but very amiable, of a fine sanguine
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.622#temper, which surprised and amused her. Besides, about two days before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.623#he had openly related to her the affair between Mouret and Clara,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.624#without any calculation, out of stupidity, like a fellow who loves a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.625#joke; and, stung with jealousy, concealing her wounded feelings beneath
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.626#an appearance of disdain, she had come to try and discover her rival, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.627#young lady in the dress department he had merely said, refusing to name
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.628#her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.629#“Do you require anything to-day?” he asked her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.630#“Of course, or else I should not have come. Have you any silk for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.631#morning gowns?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.632#She hoped to obtain the name of the young lady from him, for she was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.633#full of a desire to see her. He immediately called Favier; and resumed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.634#talking to her, whilst waiting for the salesman, who was just finishing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.635#serving a customer who happened to be “the pretty lady,” that beautiful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.636#blonde of whom the whole department occasionally spoke, without knowing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.637#anything of her life or even her name. This time the pretty lady was in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.638#deep mourning. Ah, who had she lost--her husband or her father? Not her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.639#father, or she would have appeared more melancholy. What had they been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.640#saying? She was not a gay woman then; she had a real husband. Unless,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.641#however, she should be in mourning for her mother. For a few minutes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.642#notwithstanding the press of business, the department exchanged these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.643#various speculations.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.644#“Make haste! it's intolerable!” cried Hutin to Favier, who had just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.645#returned from showing his customer to the pay-desk. “When that lady is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.646#here you never seem to finish. She doesn't care a fig for you!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.647#“She cares a deuced sight more for me than I do for her!” replied the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.648#vexed salesman.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.649#But Hutin threatened to report him to the directors if he did not show
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.650#more respect for the customers. He was getting terrible, of a morose
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.651#severity, since the department had conspired together to get him into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.652#Robineau's place. He even showed himself so intolerable, after the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.653#promises of good-fellowship, with which he had formerly warmed his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.654#colleagues, that the latter were now secretly supporting Favier against
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.655#him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.656#“Now, then, no back answers,” replied Hutin sharply. “Monsieur
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.657#Bouthemont wishes you to show some light designs in silks.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.658#In the middle of the department, an exhibition of summer silks lighted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.659#up the hall with an aurora-like brilliancy, like the rising of a star,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.660#in the most delicate tints possible: pale rose, tender yellow, limpid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.661#blue, the entire gamut of Iris. There were silks of a cloudy fineness,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.662#surahs lighter than the down falling from the trees, satined pekins soft
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.663#and supple as a Chinese virgin's skin. There were, moreover, Japanese
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.664#pongees, Indian tussores and corahs, without counting the light French
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.665#silks, the thousand stripes, the small checks, the flowered patterns,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.666#all the most fanciful designs, which made one think of ladies in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.667#furbelows, walking about, in the sweet May mornings, under the immense
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.668#trees of some park.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.669#“I'll take this, the Louis XIV. with figured roses,” said Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.670#Desforges at last.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.671#And whilst Favier was measuring it, she made a last attempt with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.672#Bouthemont, who had remained near her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.673#“I'm going up to the ready-made department to see if there are any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.674#travelling cloaks. Is she fair, the young lady you were talking about?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.675#The manager, who felt rather anxious on finding her so persistent,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.676#merely smiled. But, just at that moment, Denise went by. She had just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.677#passed on to Liénard, who had charge of the merinoes, Madame Boutarel,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.678#that provincial lady who came up to Paris twice a year, to scatter all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.679#over The Ladies' Paradise the money she scraped together out of her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.680#housekeeping. And as Favier was about to take up Madame Desforges's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.681#silk, Hutin, thinking to annoy him, interfered.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.682#“It's quite unnecessary, Mademoiselle Denise will have the kindness to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.683#conduct this lady.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.684#Denise, quite confused, at once took charge of the parcel and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.685#debit-note. She could never meet this young man face to face without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.686#experiencing a feeling of shame, as if he reminded her of a former
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.687#fault; and yet she had only sinned in her dreams.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.688#“But, tell me,” said Madame Desforges, in a low tone, to Bouthemont,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.689#“isn't it this awkward girl? He has taken her back, then? But it is she,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.690#the heroine of the adventure!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.691#“Perhaps,” replied the head of department, still smiling, and fully
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.692#decided not to tell the truth.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.693#Madame Desforges then slowly ascended the staircase, preceded by Denise;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.694#but she had to stop every two or three steps to avoid being carried away
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.695#by the descending crowd. In the living vibration of the whole
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.696#building, the iron supports seemed to stagger beneath the weight, as if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.697#continually trembling from the breath of the crowd On each stair was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.698#a dummy, strongly fixed, displaying some garment: a costume, cloak,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.699#or dressing-gown; and it was like a double row of soldiers for some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.700#triumphal march-past, with the little wooden arm like the handle of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.701#poniard, stuck into the red swan-skin, which gave a bloody appearance to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.702#the stump of a neck crowning the whole.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.703#Madame Desforges was at last reaching the first storey, when a still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.704#greater surging of the crowd forced her to stop once more. She had now,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.705#beneath her, the departments on the ground-floor, with the press of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.706#customers she had just passed through. It was a new spectacle, a sea
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.707#of heads fore-shortened, concealing the bodices, swarming with a busy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.708#agitation. The white price tickets now appeared but so many thin lines,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.709#the promontory of flannels cut through the gallery like a narrow
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.710#wall; whilst the carpets and the embroidered silks which decked the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.711#balustrades hung at her feet like processional banners suspended from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.712#the gallery of a church. In the distance, she could perceive the angles
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.713#of the lateral galleries, as from the top of a steeple one perceives
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.714#the corners of the neighbouring streets, with the black spots of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.715#passers-by moving about. But what surprised her above all, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.716#fatigue of her eyes blinded by the brilliant pell mell of colours, was,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.717#when she lowered her lids, to feel the crowe more than its dull noise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.718#like the rising tide, and the human warmth that it exhaled. A fine dust
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.719#rose from the floor, laden with the odour of woman, the odour of her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.720#linen and her bust, of her skirts and her hair, an invading, penetrating
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.721#odour, which seemed to be the incense of this temple raised for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.722#worship of her body.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.723#Meanwhile Mouret, still standing up before the reading-room with De
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.724#Vallagnosc, was inhaling this odour, intoxicating himself with it, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.725#repeating: “They are quite at home. I know some who spend the whole day
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.726#here, eating cakes and writing their letters. There's only one thing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.727#more to do, and that is, to find them beds.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.728#This joke made Paul smile, he who, in the _ennui_ of his pessimism,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.729#continued to think the crowd stupid in thus running after a lot of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.730#gew-gaws. Whenever he came to give his old comrade a look up, he went
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.731#away almost vexed to see him so full of life amidst his people of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.732#coquettes. Would not one of them, with shallow brain and empty heart,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.733#teach him one day the stupidity and uselessness of existence? That very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.734#day Octave seemed to lose some of his admirable equilibrium; he who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.735#generally inspired his customers with a fever, with the tranquil grace
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.736#of an operator, was as though seized by the passion with which the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.737#establishment was gradually burning. Since he had caught sight of Denise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.738#and Madame Desforges coming up the grand staircase, he had been talking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.739#louder, gesticulating against his will; and, whilst affecting not to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.740#turn his face towards them, he became more and more animated as he felt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.741#them drawing nearer. His face got redder, his eyes had a little of that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.742#rapture with which the eyes of his customers ultimately vacillated.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.743#“You must be robbed fearfully,” murmured De Vallagnosc, who thought the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.744#crowd looked very criminal.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.745#Mouret threw his arms out “My dear fellow, it's beyond all imagination.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.746#And, nervously, delighted at having something to talk about, he gave a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.747#number of details, related cases, and classified the subjects. In the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.748#first place, there were the professional thieves; these women did the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.749#least harm of all, for the police knew every one of them. Then came the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.750#kleptomaniacs, who stole from a perverse desire, a new sort of nervous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.751#affection which a mad doctor had classed, proving the results of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.752#temptation provided by the big shops. In the last place must be counted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.753#the women in an interesting condition, whose robberies were of a special
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.754#order. For instance, at the house of one of them, the superintendent of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.755#police had found two hundred and forty-eight pairs of pink gloves stolen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.756#from every shop in Paris.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.757#“That's what makes the women have such funny eyes here, then,” murmured
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.758#De Vallagnosc; “I've been watching them with their greedy, shameful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.759#looks, like mad creatures. A fine school for honesty!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.760#“Hang it!” replied Mouret, “though we make them quite at home, we can't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.761#let them take away the goods under their mantles. And sometimes they are
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.762#very respectable people. Last week we had the sister of a chemist, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.763#the wife of a councillor. We try and settle these matters.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.764#He stopped to point out Jouve, the inspector, who was just then looking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.765#sharp after a woman in the family way, down below at the ribbon counter.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.766#This woman, whose enormous belly suffered a great deal from the pushing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.767#of the crowd, was accompanied by a friend, whose mission appeared to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.768#to defend her against the heavy shocks, and each time she stopped in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.769#department, Jouve did not take his eyes off her, whilst her friend near
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.770#her ransacked the card-board boxes at her ease.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.771#“Oh! he'll catch her!” resumed Mouret; “he knows all their tricks.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.772#But his voice trembled, he laughed in an awkward manner. Denise and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.773#Henriette, whom he had ceased to watch, were at last passing behind him,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.774#after having had a great deal of trouble to get out of the crowd. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.775#turned round suddenly, and bowed to his customer with the discreet air
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.776#of a friend who does not wish to compromise a woman by stopping her in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.777#the middle of a crowd of people. But the latter, on the alert, had at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.778#once perceived the look with which he had first enveloped Denise. It
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.779#must be this girl, this was the rival she had had the curiosity to come
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.780#and see.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.781#In the ready-made department, the young ladies were losing their heads.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.782#Two of them had fallen ill, and Madame Frédéric, the second-hand, had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.783#quietly given notice the previous day, and gone to the cashier's office
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.784#to take her money, leaving The Ladies' Paradise all in a minute, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.785#The Ladies' Paradise itself discharged its employees. Ever since the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.786#morning, in spite of the feverish rush of business, every one had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.787#been talking of this adventure. Clara, maintained in the department by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.788#Mouret's caprice, thought it grand. Marguerite related how exasperated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.789#Bourdoncle was; whilst Madame Aurélie, greatly vexed, declared that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.790#Madame Frédéric ought at least to have informed her, for such hypocrisy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.791#had never before been heard of.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.792#Although the latter had never confided in any one, she was suspected of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.793#having given up drapery business to marry the proprietor of some of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.794#baths in the neighbourhood of the Halles.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.795#“It's a travelling cloak that madame desires, I believe?” asked Denise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.796#of Madame Desforges, after having offered her a chair.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.797#“Yes,” replied the latter, curtly, decided on being rude.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.798#The new decorations of the department were of a rich severity: high
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.799#carved oak cupboards, mirrors filling the whole space of the panels,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.800#and a red Wilton carpet, which stifled the continued movement of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.801#customers. Whilst Denise was gone for the cloaks, Madame Desforges,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.802#who was looking round, perceived herself in a glass; and she continued
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.803#contemplating herself. She must be getting old to be cast aside for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.804#the first-comer. The glass reflected the entire department with its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.805#commotion, but she only beheld her own pale face; she did not hear
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.806#Clara behind her relating to Marguerite instances of Madame Frederic's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.807#mysterious ways, the manner in which she went out of her way night and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.808#morning to go through the Passage Choiseul, in order to make believe
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.809#that she perhaps lived over the water.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.810#“Here are our latest designs,” said Denise. “We have them in several
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.811#colours.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.812#She laid out four or five cloaks. Madame Desforges looked at them with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.813#a scornful air, and became harsher at each fresh one she examined. Why
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.814#those frillings which made the garment look so scanty? and the other
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.815#one, square across the shoulders, one would have thought it had been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.816#cut out with a hatchet. Though it was for travelling she could not dress
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.817#like a sentry-box.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.818#“Show me something else, mademoiselle.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.819#Denise unfolded and folded the garments without the slightest sign of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.820#ill temper. And it was just this calm, serene patience which exasperated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.821#Madame Desforges still further. Her looks continually returned to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.822#glass in front of her. Now that she saw herself there, close to Denise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.823#she made a comparison. Was it possible that he should prefer this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.824#insignificant creature to herself? She now remembered that this was the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.825#girl she had formerly seen making her début with such a silly figure,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.826#awkward as a peasant girl just arrived from her village. No doubt she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.827#looked better now, stiff and correct in her silk dress. But how puny,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.828#how common-place!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.829#“I will show you some other models, madame,” said Denise, quietly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.830#When she returned, the scene began again. Then it was the cloth that was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.831#heavy and no good whatever. Madame Desforges turned round, raised her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.832#voice, endeavouring to attract Madame Aurélie's attention, in the hope
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.833#of getting the young girl a scolding. But Denise, since her return, had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.834#gradually conquered the department, and now felt quite at home in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.835#it; the first-hand had even recognised in her some rare and valuable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.836#qualities as a saleswoman--an obstinate sweetness, a smiling conviction.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.837#Therefore Madame Aurélie simply shrugged her shoulders, taking care not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.838#to interfere.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.839#“Would you kindly tell me the kind of garment you require, madame?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.840# asked Denise, once more, with her polite persistence, which nothing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.841#could discourage.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.842#“But you've got nothing!” exclaimed Madame Desforges.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.843#She stopped, surprised to feel a hand laid on her shoulder. It was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.844#Madame Marty, carried right through the establishment by her fever
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.845#for spending. Her purchases had increased to such an extent, since the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.846#cravats, the embroidered gloves, and the red parasol, that the last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.847#salesman had just decided to place the whole on a chair, for it would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.848#have broken his arm; and he walked in front of her, drawing the chair
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.849#along, on which was heaped up a pile of petticoats, napkins, curtains, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.850#lamp, and three straw hats.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.851#“Ah!” said she, “you are buying a travelling cloak.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.852#“Oh! dear, no,” replied Madame Desforges; “they are frightful.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.853#But Madame Marty had just noticed a striped cloak which she rather
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.854#liked. Her daughter Valentine was already examining it. So Denise called
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.855#Marguerite to clear the article out of the department, it being a model
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.856#of the previous year, and the latter, at a glance from her comrade,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.857#presented it as an exceptional bargain. When she had sworn that they had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.858#lowered the price twice, that from a hundred and fifty francs, they had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.859#reduced it to a hundred and thirty, and that it was now at a hundred and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.860#ten, Madame Marty could not withstand the temptation of its cheapness.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.861#She bought it, and the salesman who accompanied her left the chair and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.862#the parcel, with the debit-notes attached to the goods.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.863#Meanwhile, behind the ladies' backs, and amidst the jostlings of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.864#sale, the gossip of the department about Madame Frédéric still went on.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.865#“Really! she had some one?” asked a little saleswoman, fresh in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.866#department.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.867#“The bath-man of course!” replied Clara. “Mustn't trust those sly, quiet
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.868#widows.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.869#Then while Marguerite was debiting, Madam Marty turned her head and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.870#desired Clara by a slight movement of the eyebrows, she whispered to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.871#Madame Desforges: “Monsieur Mouret's caprice, you know!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.872#The other, surprised, looked at Clara; then, turning her eyes towards
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.873#Denise, replied: “But it isn't the tall one; the little one!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.874#And as Madame Marty could not be sure which, Madame Desforges resumed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.875#aloud, with the scorn of a lady for chambermaids: “Perhaps the tall one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.876#and the little one; all those who like!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.877#Denise had heard everything. She turned pale, and raised her big, pure
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.878#eyes on this lady who was thus wounding her, and whom she did not know.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.879#No doubt it was the lady of whom they had spoken to her, the lady whom
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.880#the governor saw outside. In the look that was exchanged between them,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.881#Denise displayed such a melancholy dignity, such a frank innocence, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.882#Henriette felt quite awkward.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.883#“As you have nothing presentable to show me here, conduct me to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.884#dress and costume department,” said she, abruptly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.885#“I'll go with you as well,” exclaimed Madame Marty, “I wanted to see a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.886#costume for Valentine.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.887#Marguerite took the chair by its back, and dragged it along on its hind
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.888#feet, that were getting worn by this species of cartage. Denise only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.889#carried a few yards of silk, bought by Madame Desforges. It was quite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.890#a journey, now that the robes and costumes were on the second floor, at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.891#the other end of the establishment.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.892#And the long journey commenced along the crowded galleries. Marguerite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.893#walked in front, drawing the chair along, like a little carriage,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.894#slowly opening herself a passage. As soon as she reached the under-linen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.895#department, Madame Desforges began to complain: wasn't it ridiculous, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.896#shop where one was obliged to walk a couple of leagues to find the least
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.897#thing! Madame Marty also said she was tired to death, yet she did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.898#the less enjoy this fatigue, this slow exhaustion of her strength,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.899#amidst the inexhaustible treasures displayed on every side. Mouret's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.900#idea, full of genius, seized upon her, stopping her at each department.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.901#She made a first halt before the trousseaux, tempted by some chemises
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.902#that Pauline sold her; and Marguerite found herself relieved from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.903#burden of the chair, which Pauline had to take, with the debit-notes.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.904#Madame Desforges could have gone on her road, and thus have liberated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.905#Denise quicker, but she seemed happy to feel her behind her, motionless
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.906#and patient, whilst she was lingering there, advising her friend. In
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.907#the baby-linen department the ladies went into ecstasies, without buying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.908#anything. Then Madame Marty's weakness commenced anew; she succumbed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.909#successively before a black silk corset, a pair of fur cuffs, sold at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.910#a reduction on account of the lateness of the season, and some Russian
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.911#lace much in vogue at that time for trimming table-linen. All these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.912#things were heaped up on the chair, the parcels still increased, making
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.913#the chair creak; and the salesmen who succeeded each other, found it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.914#more and more difficult to drag along as the load became heavier.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.915#“This way, madame,” said Denise without a murmur, after each halt.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.916#“But it's absurd!” exclaimed Madame Desforges. “We shall never get
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.917#there. Why not have put the dresses and costumes near the ready-made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.918#department? It is a jumble!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.919#Madame Marty, whose eyes were sparkling, intoxicated by this succession
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.920#of riches dancing before her, repeated in a half whisper:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.921#“Oh, dear! What will my husband say? You are right, there is no order in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.922#this place. You lose yourself, and commit all sorts of follies.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.923#On the great central landing, the chair, could barely pass. Mouret had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.924#just blocked the space with a lot of fancy goods, drinking-cups mounted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.925#on gilded zinc, trashy dressing-cases and liqueur stands, being of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.926#opinion that the crowd was not sufficiently great, and that circulation
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.927#was too easy. He had authorised one of his shopmen to exhibit there on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.928#a small table Chinese and Japanese curiosities, knick-knacks at a low
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.929#price, which the customers eagerly snatched up. It was an unexpected
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.930#success, and he already thought of extending this business. Whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.931#two messengers carried the chair up to the second storey, Madame Marty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.932#bought six ivory studs, some silk mice, and an enamelled match-box.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.933#On the second floor the journey was continued. Denise, who had been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.934#showing customers about in this way since the morning, was dropping with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.935#fatigue; but she still continued correct, amiable, and polite. She had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.936#to wait for the ladies again in the furnishing materials department,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.937#where a ravishing cretonne had tempted Madame Marty. Then, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.938#furniture department, it was a work-table that took her fancy. Her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.939#hands trembled, she jokingly entreated Madame Desforges to prevent her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.940#spending any more, when a meeting with Madame Guibal furnished her with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.941#an excuse. It was in the carpet department, where the latter had gone to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.942#return a lot of Oriental door-curtains bought by her five days before.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.943#And she was standing, talking to the salesman, a brawny fellow, who,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.944#with his sinewy arms handled from morning to night loads heavy enough to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.945#kill a bullock. Naturally he was quite astounded at this “return,”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.946# which deprived him of his commission. He did his best to embarrass his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.947#customer, suspecting some queer adventure, no doubt a ball given with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.948#these curtains, bought at The Ladies' Paradise, and then returned, to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.949#avoid hiring at an upholsterer's: he knew this was frequently done by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.950#the needy portion of society. In short, she must have some reason for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.951#returning them; if she did not like the designs or the colours, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.952#would show her others, he had a most complete assortment. To all these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.953#insinuations Madame Guibal replied in the quietest, most unconcerned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.954#manner possible, with a queenly assurance that the curtains did not suit
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.955#her, without deigning to add any explanation. She refused to look at any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.956#others, and he was obliged to give way, for the salesmen had orders to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.957#take back the goods, even if they saw they had been used.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.958#As the three ladies went off together, and Madame Marty referred with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.959#remorse to the work-table for which she had no earthly need, Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.960#Guibal said in her calm voice: “Well! you can return it. You saw it was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.961#quite easy. Let them send it home. You can put it in your drawing-room,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.962#keep it for a time, then if you don't like it, return it!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.963#“Ah! that's a good idea!” exclaimed Madame Marty. “If my husband makes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.964#too much fuss, I'll send everything back.” This was for her the supreme
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.965#excuse, she calculated no longer, but went on buying, with the secret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.966#wish to keep everything, for she was not a woman to give anything back.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.967#At last they arrived in the dress and costume department. But as Denise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.968#was about to deliver to another young lady the silk bought by Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.969#Desforges, the latter seemed to change her mind, and declared that she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.970#would decidedly take one of the travelling cloaks, the light grey one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.971#with the hood; and Denise had to wait complacently to bring her back
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.972#to the ready-made department. The young girl felt herself being treated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.973#like a servant by this imperious, whimsical customer; but she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.974#sworn to herself to do her duty, and retained her calm attitude,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.975#notwithstanding the rising of her heart and the shock to her pride.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.976#Madame Desforges bought nothing in the dress and costume department.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.977#“Oh! mamma,” said Valentine, “if that little costume should fit me!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.978#In a low tone, Madame Guibal was explaining her tactics to Madame Marty.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.979#When she saw a dress she liked in a shop, she had it sent home, took
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.980#the pattern of it, and then sent it back. And Madame Marty bought
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.981#the costume for her daughter remarking: “A good idea! You are very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.982#practical, my dear madame.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.983#They had been obliged to abandon the chair. It had been left in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.984#distress, in the furniture department, with the work-table. The weight
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.985#was too much, the hind legs threatened to break off; and it was arranged
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.986#that all the purchases should be centralised at one pay-desk, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.987#from there sent down to the delivery department. The ladies, still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.988#accompanied by Denise, then began wandering all about the establishment,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.989#making a second appearance in nearly every department. They seemed to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.990#take up all the space on the stairs and in the galleries. Every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.991#moment some fresh meeting brought them to a standstill. Thus, near the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.992#reading-room, they once more came across Madame Bourdelais and her three
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.993#children. The youngsters were loaded with parcels: Madeline had a dress
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.994#for herself, Edmond was carrying a collection of little shoes, whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.995#the youngest, Lucien, was wearing a new cap.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.996#“You as well!” said Madame Desforges, laughingly, to her old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.997#school-fellow.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.998#“Pray, don't speak of it!” cried out Madame Bourdelais. “I'm furious.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.999#They get hold of us by the little ones now! You know what a little I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1000#spend on myself! But how can you expect me to resist the voices of these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1001#young children, who want everything? I had come just to show them round,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1002#and here am I plundering the whole establishment!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1003#Mouret, who happened to be there still, with De Vallagnosc and Monsieur
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1004#de Boves, was listening to her with a smile. She observed it, and gaily
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1005#complained, with a certain amount of real irritation, of these traps
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1006#laid for a mother's tenderness; the idea that she had just yielded to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1007#the fevers of advertising raised her indignation, and he, still smiling,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1008#bowed, fully enjoying this triumph. Monsieur de Boves had manoeuvred so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1009#as to get near Madame Guibal, whom he ultimately followed, trying for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1010#the second time to lose De Vallagnosc; but the latter, tired of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1011#crush, hastened to rejoin him. Denise was again brought to a standstill,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1012#obliged to wait for the ladies. She turned her back, and Mouret himself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1013#affected not to see her. Madame Desforges, with the delicate scent of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1014#jealous woman, had no further doubt. Whilst he was complimenting her and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1015#walking beside her, like a gallant host, she was deep in thought, asking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1016#herself how she could convince him of his treason.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1017#Meanwhile Monsieur de Boves and De Vallagnosc, who were on in front with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1018#Madame Guibal, had reached the lace department, a luxurious room, near
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1019#the ready-made department, surrounded with stocks of carved oak drawers,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1020#which were constantly being opened and shut. Around the columns, covered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1021#with red velvet, were spirals of white lace; and from one end of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1022#department to the other, hung lengths of Maltese; whilst on the counters
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1023#there were quantities of large cards, wound round with Valenciennes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1024#Malines, and hand-made point At the further end two ladies were seated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1025#before a mauve silk skirt, on which Deloche was placing pieces of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1026#Chantilly, the ladies looking on silently, without making up their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1027#minds.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1028#“Hallo!” said De Vallagnosc, quite surprised, “you said Madame de Boves
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1029#was unwell. But there she is standing over there near that counter, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1030#Mademoiselle Blanche.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1031#The count could not help starting back, and casting a side glance at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1032#Madame Guibal.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1033#“Dear me! so she is,” said he.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1034#It was very warm in this room. The customers, half stifled, had pale
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1035#faces with flaming eyes. It seemed as if all the seductions of the shop
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1036#had converged into this supreme temptation, that it was the secluded
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1037#alcove where the customers were doomed to fall, the corner of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1038#perdition where the strongest must succumb. Hands were plunged into the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1039#overflowing heaps, retaining an intoxicating trembling from the contact.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1040#“I fancy those ladies are ruining you,” resumed De Vallagnosc, amused at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1041#the meeting.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1042#Monsieur de Boves assumed the look of a husband perfectly sure of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1043#wife's discretion, from the simple fact that he did not give her a sou
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1044#to spend. The latter, after having wandered through all the departments
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1045#with her daughter, without buying anything, had just stranded in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1046#lace department in a rage of unsated desire. Half dead with fatigue, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1047#was leaning up against the counter. She dived about in a heap of lace,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1048#her hands became soft, a warmth penetrated as far as her shoulders. Then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1049#suddenly, just as her daughter turned her head and the salesman went
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1050#away, she was thinking of slipping a piece of point d'Alençon under her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1051#mantle. But she shuddered, and dropped it, on hearing De Vallagnosc's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1052#voice saying gaily:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1053#“Ah! we've caught you, madame.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1054#For several seconds she stood there speechless and pale. Then she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1055#explained that, feeling much better, she thought she would take a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1056#stroll. And on noticing that her husband was with Madame Guibal, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1057#quite recovered herself, and looked at them with such a dignified air
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1058#that the other lady felt obliged to say:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1059#“I was with Madame Desforges when these gentlemen met us.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1060#The other ladies came up just at that moment, accompanied by Mouret,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1061#who again detained them to point out Jouve the inspector, who was still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1062#following the woman in the family way and her lady friend. It was very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1063#curious, they could not form any idea of the number of thieves that were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1064#arrested in the lace department. Madame de Boves, who was listening,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1065#fancied herself between two gendarmes, with her forty-six years, her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1066#luxury, and her husband's fine position; but yet she felt no remorse,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1067#thinking she ought to have slipped the lace up her sleeve. Jouve,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1068#however, had just decided to lay hold of the woman in the family way,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1069#despairing of catching her in the act, but fully suspecting her of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1070#having filled her pockets, with a sleight of hand which had escaped him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1071#But when he had taken her aside and searched her, he was wild to find
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1072#nothing on her--not a cravat, not a button. Her friend had disappeared.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1073#All at once he understood: the woman in the family way was only there as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1074#a blind; it was the friend who did the trick.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1075#This affair amused the ladies. Mouret, rather vexed, merely said: “Old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1076#Jouve has been floored this time. He'll have his revenge.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1077#“Oh!” replied De Vallognosc, “I don't think he's equal to it. Besides,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1078#why do you display such a quantity of goods? It serves you right, if you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1079#are robbed. You ought not to tempt these poor, defenceless women so.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1080#This was the last word, which sounded like the sharp note of the day,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1081#in the growing fever of the establishment. The ladies then separated,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1082#crossing the crowded departments for the last time. It was four o'clock,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1083#the rays of the setting sun were darting through the large windows in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1084#the front, lighting up crossways the glazed roofs of the halls, and in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1085#this red, fiery light sprung up, like a golden vapour, the thick dust
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1086#raised by the circulation of the crowd. A broad ray ran along the grand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1087#central gallery, showing up on a flaming ground the staircases, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1088#flying bridges, all the network of suspended iron. The mosaics and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1089#terra-cotta of the friezes sparkled, the green andred paint were lighted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1090#up by the fire of the masses of gold scattered everywhere. It was like a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1091#red-hot furnace, in which the displays were now burning, the palaces of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1092#gloves and cravats, the clusters of ribbons and lace, the lofty piles of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1093#linen and calico, the diapered parterres in which flourished the light
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1094#silks and foulards. The exhibition of parasols, with their shield-like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1095#roundness, threw out a sort of metallic reflection. In the distance were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1096#a lot of lost counters, sparkling, swarming with a moving crowd, ablaze
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1097#with sunshine.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1098#And at this last moment, amidst this over-warmed air, the women reigned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1099#supreme. They had taken the whole place by storm, camping there as in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1100#a conquered country, like an invading horde installed amongst the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1101#overhauling of the goods. The salesmen, deafened, knocked up, were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1102#now nothing but their slaves, of whom they disposed with a sovereign's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1103#tyranny. Fat women elbowed their way through the crowd. The thinnest
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1104#ones took up a lot of space, and became quite arrogant. They were all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1105#there, with heads high and abrupt gestures, quite at home, without the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1106#slightest politeness one for the other, using the house as much as they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1107#could, even carrying away the dust from the walls. Madame Bourdelais,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1108#desirous of making up for her expenditure, had again taken her children
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1109#to the refreshment bar; the crowd was now pushing about there in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1110#furious way, even the mothers were gorging themselves with Malaga; they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1111#had drunk since the opening eighty quarts of syrup and seventy bottles
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1112#of wine. After having bought her travelling cloak, Madame Desforges
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1113#had managed to secure some pictures at the pay-desk; and she went away
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1114#scheming to get Denise into her house, where she could humiliate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1115#her before Mouret himself, so as to see their faces and arrive at a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1116#conclusion. Whilst Monsieur de Boves succeeded in losing himself in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1117#crowd and disappearing with Madame Guibal, Madame de Boves, followed by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1118#Blanche and De Vallagnosc, had had the fancy to ask for a red air-ball,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1119#although she had bought nothing. It was always something, she would not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1120#go away empty-handed, she would make a friend of her doorkeeper's little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1121#girl with it. At the distributing counter they were just commencing the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1122#fortieth thousand: forty thousand red air-balls which had taken flight
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1123#in the warm air of the shop, quite a cloud of red air-balls which were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1124#now floating from one end of Paris to the other, bearing upwards to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1125#sky the name of The Ladies' Paradise!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1126#Five o'clock struck. Of all the ladies, Madame Marty and her daughter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1127#were the only ones to remain, in the final crisis of the sale. She could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1128#not tear herself away, although ready to drop with fatigue, retained by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1129#an attraction so strong that she was continually retracing her steps,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1130#though wanting nothing, wandering about the departments out of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1131#curiosity that knew no bounds. It was the moment in which the crowd,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1132#goaded on by the advertisements, completely lost itself; the sixty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1133#thousand francs paid to the newspapers, the ten thousand bills posted on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1134#the walls, the two hundred thousand catalogues distributed all over the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1135#world, after having emptied their purses, left in the women's minds the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1136#shock of their intoxication; and the customers still remained, shaken by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1137#Mouret's other inventions, the reduction of prices, the “returns,” the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1138#endless gallantries. Madame Marty lingered before the various stalls,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1139#amidst the hoarse cries of the salesmen, the chinking of the gold at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1140#pay-desks, and the rolling of the parcels down into the basement; she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1141#again traversed the ground floor, the linen, the silk, the glove,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1142#and the woollen departments; then she went upstairs again, abandoning
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1143#herself to the metallic vibrations of the suspended staircases and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1144#flying-bridges, returning to the ready-made, the under-linen, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1145#the lace departments; she even ascended to the second floor, into the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1146#heights of the bedding and furniture department; and everywhere the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1147#employees, Hutin and Favier, Mignot and Liénard, Deloche, Pauline and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1148#Denise, nearly dead with fatigue, were making a last effort, snatching
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1149#victories from the expiring fever of the customers. This fever had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1150#gradually increased since the morning, like the intoxication arising
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1151#from the tumbling of the stuffs. The crowd shone forth under the fiery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1152#glare of the five o'clock sun. Madame Marty's face was now animated and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1153#nervous, like that of an infant after drinking pure wine. Arrived with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1154#clear eyes and fresh skin from the cold of the street, she had slowly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1155#burnt her sight and complexion, at the spectacle of this luxury, of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1156#these violent colours, the continued gallop of which irritated her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1157#passion. When she at last went away, after saying she would pay at home,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1158#terrified by the amount of her bill, her features were drawn up, her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1159#eyes were like those of a sick person. She was obliged to fight her way
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1160#through the crowd at the door, where the people were almost killing each
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1161#other, amidst the struggle for the bargains. Then, when she got into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1162#the street, and found her daughter, whom she had lost for a moment, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1163#fresh air made her shiver, she stood there frightened in the disorder of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1164#this neurosis of the immense establishments.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1165#In the evening, as Denise was returning from dinner, a messenger called
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1166#her: “You are wanted at the director's office, mademoiselle.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1167#She had forgotten the order Mouret had given her in the morning, to go
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1168#to his office after the sale. He was standing waiting for her. On going
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1169#in she did not close the door, which remained, wide open.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1170#“We are very pleased with you, mademoiselle,” said he, “and we have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1171#thought of proving our satisfaction. You know in what a shameful manner
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1172#Madame Frédéric has left us. From to-morrow you will take her place as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1173#second-hand.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1174#Denise listened to him immovable with surprise. She murmured in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1175#trembling voice: “But, sir, there are saleswomen in the department who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1176#are much my seniors.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1177#“What does that matter?” resumed he. “You are the most capable, the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1178#trustworthy. I choose you; it's quite natural. Are you not satisfied?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1179#She blushed, feeling a delicious happiness and embarrassment, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1180#which her first fright vanished. Why had she at once thought of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1181#suppositions with which this unhoped for favour would be received? And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1182#she stood filled with her confusion, notwithstanding her sudden burst of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1183#gratitude. He was looking at her with a smile, in her simple silk dress,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1184#without a single piece of jewellery, nothing but the luxury of her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1185#royal, blonde head of hair. She had become more refined, her skin was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1186#whiter, her manner delicate and grave. Her former puny insignificance
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1187#was developing into a charm of a penetrating discretion.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1188#“You are very kind, sir,” she stammered. “I don't know how to tell
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1189#you----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1190#But she was cut short by the appearance of Lhomme in the doorway. In his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1191#hand he was holding a large leather bag, and with his mutilated arm he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1192#was pressing an enormous notecase to his chest; whilst, behind him, his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1193#son Albert was carrying a load of bags, which were weighing him down.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1194#“Five hundred and eighty-seven thousand two hundred and ten francs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1195#thirty centimes!” cried out the cashier, whose flabby, used-up face
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1196#seemed to be lighted up with a ray of sunshine, in the reflection of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1197#such a sum.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1198#It was the day's receipts, the highest The Ladies' Paradise had ever
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1199#done. In the distance, in the depths of the shop that Lhomme had just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1200#passed through slowly, with the heavy gait of an overloaded beast of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1201#burden, one could hear the uproar, the ripple of surprise and joy, left
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1202#by this colossal sum which passed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1203#“But it's superb!” said Mouret, enchanted. “My good Lhomme, put it down
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1204#there, and take a rest, for you look quite done up. I'll have this money
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1205#taken to the central cashier's office. Yes, yes, put it all on my table,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1206#I want to see the heap.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1207#He was full of a childish gaiety. The cashier and his son laid down
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1208#their burdens. The leather bag gave out a clear, golden ring, two of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1209#other bags bursting let out a stream of silver and copper, whilst from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1210#the note-case peeped forth corners of bank notes. One end of the large
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1211#table was entirely covered; it was like the tumbling of a fortune picked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1212#up in ten hours.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1213#When Lhomme and Albert had retired, mopping their faces, Mouret remained
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1214#for a moment motionless, lost, his eyes fixed on the money. Then,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1215#raising his head, he perceived Denise, who had drawn back. He began to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1216#smile again, forced her to come forward, and finished by saying he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1217#would give her all she could take in her hand; and there was a sort of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1218#love-bargain beneath his playfulness.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1219#“Look! out of the bag. I bet it would be less than a thousand francs,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1220#your hand is so small!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1221#But she drew back again. He loved her, then? Suddenly she understood,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1222#she felt the growing flame of desire with which he had enveloped her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1223#since, her return to the shop. What overcame her more than anything else
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1224#was to feel her heart beating violently. Why did he wound her with all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1225#this money, when she was overflowing with gratitude, and he could have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1226#done anything with her by a friendly word? He was coming closer to her,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1227#continuing to joke, when, to his great annoyance, Bourdoncle appeared,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1228#under the pretence of informing him of the number of entries--the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1229#enormous number of seventy thousand customers had entered The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1230#Paradise that day. And she hastened away, after having again thanked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:ix.1231#him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1#CHAPTER X.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.2#The first Sunday in August every one was busy with the stock-taking,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.3#which had to be finished by the evening. Early in the morning all the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.4#employees were at their posts, as on a week-day, and the work commenced
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.5#with closed doors, in the immense establishment, entirely free from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.6#customers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.7#Denise, however, had not come down with the other young ladies at eight
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.8#o'clock. Confined to her room for the last five days by a sprained
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.9#ankle, caused when going up stairs to the work-rooms, she was going on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.10#much better; but, sure of Madame Aurélie's indulgence, she did not hurry
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.11#down, and sat putting her boots on with difficulty, resolved, however,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.12#to show herself in the department. The young ladies' bed-rooms now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.13#occupied the entire fifth storey of the new buildings, along the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.14#Monsigny; there were sixty of them, on either side of a corridor, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.15#they were much more comfortable than formerly, although still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.16#furnished with the iron bedstead, large wardrobe, and little mahogany
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.17#toilet-table. The private life of the saleswomen became more refined and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.18#elegant there, they displayed a taste for scented soap and fine linen,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.19#quite a natural ascent towards middle-class ways as their positions
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.20#improved, although high words and banging doors were still sometimes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.21#heard amidst the hôtel-like gust that carried them away, morning and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.22#evening. Denise, being second-hand in her department, had one of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.23#largest rooms, the two attic windows of which looked into the street.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.24#Being much better off now, she indulged in several little luxuries, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.25#red eider-down coverlet for the bed, covered with Maltese lace, a small
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.26#carpet in front of the wardrobe, and two blue-glass vases containing a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.27#few faded roses on the toilet table.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.28#When she got her boots on she tried to walk across the room; but was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.29#obliged to lean against the furniture, being still rather lame. But that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.30#would soon come right again, she thought. At the same time, she had been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.31#quite right in refusing the invitation to dine at uncle Baudu's that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.32#evening, and in asking her aunt to take Pépé out for a walk, for she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.33#had placed him with Madame Gras again. Jean, who had been to see her the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.34#previous day, was to dine at his uncle's also. She continued to try to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.35#walk, resolved to go to bed early, in order to rest her leg, when Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.36#Cabin, the housekeeper, knocked and gave her a letter, with an air of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.37#mystery.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.38#The door closed. Denise, astonished by this woman's discreet smile,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.39#opened the letter. She dropped on to a chair; it was a letter from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.40#Mouret, in which he expressed himself delighted at her recovery, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.41#begged her to go down and dine with him that evening, as she could not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.42#go out. The tone of this note, at once familiar and paternal, was in no
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.43#way offensive; but it was impossible for her to mistake its meaning. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.44#Ladies' Paradise well knew the real signification of these invitations,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.45#which were legendary: Clara had dined, others as well, all those the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.46#governor had specially remarked. After dinner, as the witlings were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.47#wont to say, came the dessert. And the young girl's white cheeks were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.48#gradually invaded by a flow of blood.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.49#The letter slipped on to her knees, and Denise, her heart beating
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.50#violently, remained with her eyes fixed on the blinding light of one of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.51#the windows. This was the confession she must have made to herself, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.52#this very room, during her sleepless moments: if she still trembled when
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.53#he passed, she now knew it was not from fear; and her former uneasiness,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.54#her old terror, could have been nothing but the frightened ignorance of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.55#love, the disorder of her growing affections, in her youthful wildness.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.56#She did not argue with herself, she simply felt that she had always
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.57#loved him from the hour she had shuddered and stammered before him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.58#She had loved him when she had feared him as a pitiless master; she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.59#loved him when her distracted heart was dreaming of Hutin, unconsciously
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.60#yielding to a desire for affection. Perhaps she might have given herself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.61#to another, but she had never loved any but this man, whose mere look
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.62#terrified her. And her whole past life came back to her, unfolding
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.63#itself in the blinding light of the window: the hardships of her start,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.64#that sweet walk under the shady trees of the Tuileries Gardens, and,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.65#lastly, the desires with which he had enveloped her ever since her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.66#return. The letter dropped on the ground, Denise still gazed at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.67#window, dazzled by the glare of the sun.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.68#Suddenly there was a knock. She hastened to pick up the letter and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.69#conceal it in her pocket. It was Pauline, who, having slipped away under
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.70#some pretext, had come for a little gossip.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.71#“How are you, my dear? We never meet now----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.72#But as it was against the rules to go up into the bed-rooms, and, above
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.73#all, for two to be shut in together, Denise took her to the end of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.74#passage, into the ladies' drawing-room, a gallant present from Mouret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.75#to the young ladies, who could spend their evenings there till eleven
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.76#o'clock. The apartment, decorated in white and gold, of the vulgar
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.77#nudity of an hôtel room, was furnished with a piano, a central table,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.78#and some arm-chairs and sofas protected with white covers. But, after
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.79#a few evenings spent together, in the first novelty of the thing, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.80#saleswomen never went into the place without coming to high words at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.81#once. They required educating to it, the little trading city was wanting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.82#in accord. Meanwhile, almost the only one that went there in the evening
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.83#was the second-hand in the corset department, Miss Powell, who strummed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.84#away at Chopin on the piano, and whose coveted talent ended by driving
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.85#the others away.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.86#“You see my ankle's better now,” said Denise, “I was going downstairs.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.87#“Well!” exclaimed the other, “what zeal! I'd take it easy if I had the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.88#chance!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.89#They both sat down on a sofa. Pauline's attitude had changed since her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.90#friend had been promoted to be second-hand in the ready-made department.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.91#With her good-natured cordiality was mingled a shade of respect, a sort
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.92#of surprise to feel the puny little saleswoman of former days on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.93#road to fortune. Denise liked her very much, and confided in her alone,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.94#amidst the continual gallop of the two hundred women that the firm now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.95#employed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.96#“What's the matter?” asked Pauline, quickly, when she remarked the young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.97#girl's troubled looks.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.98#“Oh! nothing,” replied the latter, with an awkward smile.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.99#“Yes, yes; there's something the matter with you. Have you no faith in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.100#me, that you have given up telling me your troubles?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.101#Then Denise, in the emotion that was swelling her bosom--an emotion
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.102#she could not control--abandoned herself to her feelings. She gave her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.103#friend the letter, stammering: “Look! he has just written to me.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.104#Between themselves, they had never openly spoken of Mouret. But this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.105#very silence was like a confession of their secret pre-occupations.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.106#Pauline knew everything. After having read the letter, she clasped
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.107#Denise in her arms, and softly murmured: “My dear, to speak frankly, I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.108#thought it was already done. Don't be shocked; I assure you the whole
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.109#shop must think as I do. Naturally! he appointed you as second-hand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.110#so quickly, then he's always after you. It's obvious!” She kissed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.111#her affectionately, and then asked her: “You will go this evening, of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.112#course?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.113#Denise looked at her without replying. All at once she burst into tears,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.114#her head on Pauline's shoulder. The latter was quite astonished.'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.115#“Come, try and calm yourself; there's nothing in the affair to upset you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.116#like this.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.117#“No, no; let me be,” stammered Denise. “If you only knew what trouble I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.118#am in! Since I received that letter, I have felt beside myself. Let me
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.119#have a good cry, that will relieve me.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.120#Full of pity, though not understanding, Pauline endeavoured to console
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.121#her. In the first place, he had thrown up Clara. It was said he still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.122#visited a lady outside, but that was not proved. Then she explained that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.123#one could not be jealous of a man in such a position. He had too much
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.124#money; he was the master, after all Denise listened to her, and had she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.125#been ignorant of her love, she could no longer have doubted it after
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.126#the suffering she felt at the name of Clara and the allusion to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.127#Madame Desforges, which made her heart bleed. She could hear Clara's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.128#disagreeable voice, she could see Madame Desforges dragging her about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.129#the different departments with the scorn of a rich lady for a poor
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.130#shop-girl.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.131#“So you would go yourself?” asked she.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.132#Pauline, without pausing to think, cried out: “Of course, how can one do
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.133#otherwise!” Then reflecting, she added: “Not now, but formerly, because
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.134#now I am going to marry Bauge, and it would not be right.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.135#In fact, Bauge, who had left the Bon Marche for The Ladies' Paradise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.136#was going to marry her about the middle of the month. Bourdoncle did
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.137#not like these married couples; they had managed, however, to get the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.138#necessary permission, and even hoped to obtain a fortnight's holiday for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.139#their honeymoon.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.140#“There you are,” declared Denise, “when a man loves a girl he ought to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.141#marry her. Bauge is going to marry you.” Pauline laughed heartily. “But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.142#my dear, it isn't the same thing. Baugé is going to marry me because he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.143#is Bauge. He's my equal, that's a natural thing. Whilst Monsieur Mouret!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.144#Do you think Monsieur Mouret can marry his saleswomen?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.145#“Oh! no, oh! no,” exclaimed the young girl, shocked by the absurdity the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.146#question, “and that's why he ought not to have written to me.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.147#This argument completely astonished Pauline. Her coarse face, with her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.148#small tender eyes, assumed quite an expression of maternal compassion.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.149#Then she got up, opened the piano, and softly played with one finger,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.150#“King Dagobert,” to enliven the situation, no doubt. Into the nakedness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.151#of the drawingroom, the white coverings of which seemed to increase the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.152#emptiness, came the noises from the street, the distant melopoia of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.153#woman crying out green peas. Denise had thrown herself back on the sofa,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.154#her head against the wood-work, shaken by a fresh flood of sobs, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.155#she stifled in her handkerchief.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.156#“Again!” resumed Pauline, turning round. “Really you are not reasonable.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.157#Why did you bring me here? We ought to have stopped in your room.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.158#She knelt down before her, and commenced lecturing her again. How many
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.159#others would like to be in her place! Besides, if the thing did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.160#please her, it was very simple: she had only to say no, without worrying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.161#herself like this. But she should reflect before risking her position
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.162#by a refusal which was inexplicable, considering she had no engagement
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.163#elsewhere. Was it such a terrible thing after all? and the reprimand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.164#was finishing up by some pleasantries, gaily whispered, when a sound of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.165#footsteps was heard in the passage. Pauline ran to the door and looked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.166#out. “Hush! Madame Aurélie!” she murmured. “I'm off, and just you dry
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.167#your eyes. She need not know what's up.” When Denise was alone, she got
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.168#up, and forced back her tears; and, her hands still trembling, with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.169#fear of being caught there doing nothing, she closed the piano, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.170#her friend had left open. But on hearing Madame Aurélie knocking at her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.171#door, she left the drawing-room.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.172#“What! you are up!” exclaimed the first-hand. “It's very thoughtless
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.173#of you, my dear child. I was just coming up to see how you were, and to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.174#tell you that we did not require you downstairs.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.175#Denise assured her that she felt very much better, that it would do her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.176#good to do something to amuse herself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.177#“I sha'nt tire myself, madame. You can place me on a chair, and I'll do
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.178#some writing.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.179#Both then went downstairs. Madame Aurélie, who was most attentive,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.180#insisted on Denise leaning on her shoulder. She must have noticed the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.181#young girl's red eyes, for she was stealthily examining her. No doubt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.182#she was aware of a great deal of what was going on.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.183#It was an unexpected victory: Denise had at last conquered the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.184#department. After struggling for six months, amidst her torments as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.185#drudge and fag, without disarming her comrades' ill-will, she had in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.186#few weeks entirely overcome them, and now saw them around her submissive
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.187#and respectful. Madame Aurélie's sudden affection had greatly assisted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.188#her in this ungrateful task of softening her comrades' hearts towards
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.189#her. It was whispered that the first-hand was Mouret's obliging
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.190#factotum, that she rendered him many delicate services; and she took the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.191#young girl under her protection with such warmth that the latter must
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.192#have been recommended to her in a very special manner. But Denise had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.193#also brought all her charm into play in order to disarm her enemies.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.194#The task was all the more difficult from the fact that she had to obtain
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.195#their pardon for her appointment to the situation of second-hand. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.196#young ladies spoke of this as an injustice, accused her of having earned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.197#it at dessert, with the governor; and even added a lot of abominable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.198#details. But in spite of their revolt, the title of second-hand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.199#influenced them, Denise assumed a certain authority which astonished and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.200#overawed the most hostile spirits. Soon after, she even found flatterers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.201#amongst the new hands; and her sweetness and modesty finished the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.202#conquest. Marguerite came over to her side. Clara was the only one to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.203#continue her ill-natured ways, still venturing on the old insult of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.204#the “unkempt girl,” which no one now saw the fun of. During her short
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.205#intimacy with Mouret, she had taken advantage of it to neglect her work,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.206#being of a wonderfully idle, gossiping nature; then, as he had quickly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.207#tired of her, she did not even recriminate, incapable of jealousy in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.208#the disorderly abandon of her existence, perfectly satisfied to have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.209#profited from it to the extent of being allowed to stand about doing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.210#nothing. But, at the same time, she considered that Denise had robbed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.211#her of Madame Frederic's place. She would never have accepted it, on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.212#account of the worry; but she was vexed at the want of politeness, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.213#she had the same claims as the other one, and prior claims too.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.214#“Hullo! there's the young mother being trotted out after her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.215#confinement,” murmured she, on seeing Madame Aurélie bringing Denise in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.216#on her arm.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.217#Marguerite shrugged her shoulders, saying, “I dare say you think that's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.218#a good joke!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.219#Nine o'clock struck. Outside, an ardent blue sky was warming the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.220#streets.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.221#Cabs were rolling toward the railway stations, the whole population
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.222#dressed out in Sunday clothes, was streaming in long rows towards the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.223#suburban woods.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.224#Inside the building, inundated with sun through the large open bays, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.225#cooped-up staff had just commenced the stocktaking. They had closed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.226#the doors; people stopped on the pavement, looking through the windows,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.227#astonished at this shutting-up when an extraordinary activity was going
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.228#on inside. There was, from one end of the galleries to the other, from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.229#the top floor to the bottom, a continual movement of employees, their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.230#arms in the air, and parcels flying about above their heads; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.231#all this amidst a tempest of cries and a calling out of prices, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.232#confusion of which ascended and became a deafening roar. Each of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.233#thirty-nine departments did its work apart, without troubling about its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.234#neighbour. At this early hour the shelves had hardly been touched, there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.235#were only a few bales of goods on the floors; the machine would have to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.236#get up more steam if they were to finish that evening.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.237#“Why have you come down?” asked Marguerite of Denise, good-naturedly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.238#“You'll only make yourself worse, and we are quite enough to do the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.239#work.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.240#“That's what I told her,” declared Madame Aurélie, “but she insisted on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.241#coming down to help us.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.242#All the young ladies flocked round Denise. The work was interrupted even
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.243#for a time. They complimented her, listening with various exclamations
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.244#to the story of her sprained ankle. At last Madame Aurélie made her sit
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.245#down at a table; and it was understood that she should merely write
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.246#down the articles as they were called out. On such a day as this they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.247#requisitioned any employee capable of holding a pen: the inspectors, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.248#cashiers, the clerks, even down to the shop messengers; and the various
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.249#departments divided amongst themselves these assistants of a day to get
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.250#the work over quicker. It was thus that Denise found herself installed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.251#near Lhomme the cashier and Joseph the messenger, both bending over
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.252#large sheets of paper.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.253#“Five mantles, cloth, fur trimming, third size, at two hundred and forty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.254#francs!” cried Marguerite. “Four ditto, first size, at two hundred and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.255#twenty!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.256#The work once more commenced. Behind Marguerite three saleswomen were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.257#emptying the cupboards, classifying the articles, giving them to her in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.258#bundles; and, when she had called them out, she threw them on the table,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.259#where they were gradually heaping up in enormous piles. Lhomme wrote
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.260#down the articles, Joseph kept another list for the clearinghouse.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.261#Whilst this was going on, Madame Aurélie herself, assisted by three
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.262#other saleswomen, was counting the silk garments, which Denise entered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.263#on the sheets. Clara was employed in looking after the heaps, to arrange
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.264#them in such a manner that they should occupy the least space possible
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.265#on the tables. But she was not paying much attention to her work, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.266#the heaps were already tumbling down.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.267#“I say,” asked she of a little saleswoman who had joined that winter,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.268#“are they going to give you a rise? You know the second-hand is to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.269#have two thousand francs, which, with her commission, will bring her in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.270#nearly seven thousand.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.271#The little saleswoman, without ceasing to pass some cloaks down, replied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.272#that if they didn't give her eight hundred francs she would take her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.273#hook. The rises were always given the day after the stock-taking; it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.274#was also the epoch at which, the amount of business done during the year
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.275#being known, the managers of the departments drew their commission on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.276#the increase of this figure, compared with that of the preceding year.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.277#Thus, notwithstanding the bustle and uproar of the work, the impassioned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.278#gossiping went on everywhere. Between two articles called out, they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.279#talked of nothing but money. The rumour ran that Madame Aurélie would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.280#exceed twenty-five thousand francs; and this immense sum greatly excited
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.281#the young ladies. Marguerite, the best saleswoman after Denise, had made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.282#four thousand five hundred francs, fifteen hundred francs salary, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.283#about three thousand francs commission; whilst Clara had not made two
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.284#thousand five hundred francs altogether.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.285#“I don't care a button for their rises!” resumed the latter, still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.286#talking to the little saleswoman. “If papa were dead, I would jolly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.287#soon clear out of this! But what exasperates me is to see seven thousand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.288#francs given to that strip of a girl! What do you say?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.289#Madame Aurélie violently interrupted the conversation, turning round
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.290#with her imperial air. “Be quiet, young ladies! We can't hear ourselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.291#speak, my word of honour!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.292#Then she resumed calling out: “Seven mantles, old style, Sicilian, first
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.293#size, at a hundred and thirty! Three pelisses, surah, second size, at a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.294#hundred and fifty! Have you got that down, Mademoiselle Baudu?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.295#“Yes, madame.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.296#Clara then had to look after the armfuls of garments piled on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.297#tables. She pushed them about, and made more room. But she soon left
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.298#them again to reply to a salesman, who was looking for her. It was the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.299#glover, Mignot, escaped from his department. He whispered a request for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.300#twenty francs; he already owed her thirty, a loan effected the day after
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.301#a race, after having lost his week's salary on a horse; this time he had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.302#squandered his commission, drawn over night, and had not ten sous for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.303#his Sunday. Clara had only ten francs about her, which she lent him with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.304#a fairly good grace. And they went on talking, spoke of a party of six,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.305#indulged in at a restaurant at Bougival, where the women had paid their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.306#share: it was much better, they all felt perfectly at their ease like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.307#that. Then Mignot, who wanted his twenty francs, went and bent over
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.308#Lhomme's shoulder. The latter, stopped in his writing, appeared greatly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.309#troubled. However, he dared not refuse, and was looking for the money
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.310#in his purse, when Madame Aurélie, astonished not to hear Marguerite's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.311#voice, which had been interrupted, perceived Mignot, and understood at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.312#once. She roughly sent him back to his department, saying she didn't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.313#want any one to come and distract her young ladies from their work. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.314#truth is, she dreaded this young man, a bosom friend of Albert's, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.315#accomplice of his doubtful tricks, which she trembled to see turn out
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.316#badly some day. Therefore, when Mignot had got his ten francs, and had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.317#run away, she could not help saying to her husband:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.318#“Is it possible to let a fellow like that get over you!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.319#“But, my dear, I really could not refuse the young man.” She closed his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.320#mouth with a shrug of her substantial shoulders. Then, as the saleswomen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.321#were slyly grinning at this family explanation, she resumed with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.322#severity: “Now, Mademoiselle Vadon, don't let's go to sleep.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.323#“Twenty cloaks, cashmere extra, fourth size, at eighteen francs and a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.324#half,” resumed Marguerite in her sing-song voice.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.325#Lhomme, with his head bowed down, had resumed writing. They had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.326#gradually raised his salary to nine thousand francs a year; and he was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.327#very humble before Madame Aurélie, who still brought nearly triple as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.328#much into the family.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.329#For a while the work pushed forward. Figures flew about, the parcels
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.330#of garments rained thick and fast on the tables, But Clara had invented
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.331#another amusement: she was teasing the messenger, Joseph, about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.332#a passion that he was said to nourish for a young lady in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.333#pattern-room. This young lady, already twenty-eight years old, thin and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.334#pale, was a protege of Madame Desforges, who had wanted to make Mouret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.335#engage her as a saleswoman, backing up her recommendation with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.336#touching story: an orphan, the last of the De Fontenailles, an old and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.337#noble family of Poitou, thrown into the streets of Paris with a drunken
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.338#father, but yet virtuous amidst this misfortune, with an education too
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.339#limited, unfortunately, to take a place as governess or music-mistress.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.340#Mouret generally got angry when any one recommended to him these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.341#broken-down gentlewomen; there was not, said he, a class of creatures
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.342#more incapable, more insupportable, more narrow-minded than these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.343#gentlewomen; and, besides, a saleswoman could not be improvised,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.344#she must serve an apprenticeship, it was a complicated and delicate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.345#business. However, he took Madame Desforges's protege, but put her in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.346#the pattern-room, in the same way as he had already found places, to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.347#oblige friends, for two countesses and a baroness in the advertising
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.348#department, where they addressed envelopes, etc. Mademoiselle de
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.349#Fontenailles earned three francs a day, which just enabled her to live
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.350#in her modest room, in the Rue d'Argenteuil. It was on seeing her, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.351#her sad look and such shabby clothes, that Joseph's heart, very tender
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.352#under his rough soldier's manner, had been touched. He did not confess,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.353#but he blushed, when the young ladies in the ready-made department
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.354#chaffed him; for the pattern-room was not far off, and they had often
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.355#observed him prowling about the doorway.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.356#“Joseph is somewhat absent-minded,” murmured Clara. “His nose is always
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.357#turned towards the under-linen department.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.358#They had requisitioned Mademoiselle de Fontenailles there, and she was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.359#assisting at the outfitting counter. As the messenger was continually
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.360#glancing in that direction, the saleswomen began to laugh. He became
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.361#very confused, and plunged into his accounts; whilst Marguerite, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.362#order to arrest the flood of gaiety which was tickling her throat, cried
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.363#out louder stills “Fourteen jackets, English cloth, second size, at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.364#fifteen francs!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.365#At this, Madame Aurélie, who was engaged in calling out some cloaks,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.366#could not make herself heard. She interfered with a wounded air, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.367#a majestic slowness: “A little softer, mademoiselle. We are not in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.368#market. And you are all very unreasonable, to be amusing yourselves with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.369#these childish matters, when our time is so precious.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.370#Just at that moment, as Clara was not paying any attention to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.371#parcels, a catastrophe took place. Some mantles tumbled down, and all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.372#the heaps on the tables, dragged down with them, fell one after the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.373#other, so that the carpet was strewn with them.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.374#“There! what did I say!” cried the first-hand, beside herself. “Pray be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.375#more careful, Mademoiselle Prunaire; it's intolerable!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.376#But a hum ran along: Mouret and Bourdoncle, making their round of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.377#inspection, had just appeared. The voices started again, the pens
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.378#sputtered along, whilst Clara hastened to pick up the garments. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.379#governor did not interrupt the work. He stood there several minutes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.380#mute, smiling; and it was on his lips alone that a slight feverish
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.381#shivering was visible in his gay and victorious face of stock-taking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.382#days. When he perceived Denise, he nearly gave way to a gesture of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.383#astonishment. She had come down, then? His eyes met Madame Aurélie's.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.384#Then, after a moment's hesitation, he went away into the under-linen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.385#department.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.386#However, Denise, warned by the slight noise, had raised her head. And,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.387#after having recognised Mouret, she had immediately bent over her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.388#work again, without ostentation. Since she had been writing in this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.389#mechanical way, amidst the regular calling-out of the articles, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.390#peaceful feeling had stolen over her. She had always yielded thus to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.391#the first excesses of her sensitiveness: the tears suffocated her,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.392#her passion doubled her torments; then she regained her self-command,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.393#finding a grand, calm courage, a strength of will, quiet but inexorable.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.394#Now, with her limpid eyes, and pale complexion, she was free from all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.395#agitation, entirely given up to her work, resolved to crush her heart
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.396#and to do nothing but her will.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.397#Ten o'clock struck, the uproar of the stock-taking was increasing in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.398#activity of the departments. And amidst the cries incessantly raised,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.399#crossing each other on all sides, the same news was circulating with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.400#surprising rapidity: every salesman knew that Mouret had written that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.401#morning inviting Denise to dinner. The indiscretion came from Pauline.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.402#On going downstairs, still excited, she had met Deloche in the lace
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.403#department, and, without noticing that Liénard was talking to the young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.404#man, she immediately relieved her mind of the secret.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.405#“It's done, my dear fellow. She's just received a letter. He invites her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.406#for this evening.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.407#Deloche turned very pale. He had understood, for he often questioned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.408#Pauline; they spoke of their common friend every day, of Mouret's love
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.409#for her, of the famous invitation which would finish by bringing the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.410#adventure to an issue. She frequently scolded him for his secret love
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.411#for Denise, with whom he would never succeed, and she shrugged her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.412#shoulders whenever he expressed his approval of the girl's conduct in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.413#resisting the governor.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.414#“Her foot's better, she's coming down,” continued Pauline.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.415#“Pray don't put on that funeral face. It's a piece of good luck for her,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.416#this invitation.” And she hastened back to her department.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.417#“Ah! good!” murmured Liénard, who had heard all, “you're talking about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.418#the young girl with the sprain. You were quite right to be so quick in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.419#defending her last night at the café!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.420#He also ran off; but before he had returned to the woollen department,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.421#he had already related the story to four or five fellows. In less than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.422#ten minutes, it had gone the round of the whole shop.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.423#Liénard's last remark referred to a scene which had taken place the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.424#previous evening, at the Café Saint-Roch. Deloche and he were now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.425#constantly together. The former had taken Hutin's room at the Hôtel de
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.426#Smyme, when that gentleman, appointed second-hand, had hired a suite of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.427#three rooms; and the two shopmen came to The Ladies' Paradise together
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.428#in the morning, and waited for each other in the evening in order to go
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.429#away together. Their rooms, which were next door to each other, looked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.430#into the same black yard, a narrow well, the odour from which poisoned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.431#the hôtel. They got on very well together, notwithstanding their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.432#difference of character, the one carelessly squandering the money he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.433#drew from his father, the other penniless, perpetually tortured by ideas
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.434#of saving, both having, however, a point in common, their unskilfulness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.435#as salesmen, which left them to vegetate at their counters, without any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.436#increase of salary. After leaving the shop, they spent the greater part
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.437#of their time at the Café Saint-Roch. Quite free from customers during
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.438#the day, this café filled up about halfpast eight with an overflowing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.439#crowd of employees, that crowd of shopmen disgorged into the street from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.440#the great door in the Place Gaillon. Then burst forth a deafening uproar
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.441#of clinking dominoes, bursts of laughter and yelping voices, amidst the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.442#thick smoke of the pipes. Beer and coffee were in great demand. Seated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.443#in the left-hand corner, Liénard went in for the dearest drinks, whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.444#Deloche contented himself with a glass of beer, which he would take
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.445#four hours to drink. It was there that the latter had heard Favier, at a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.446#neighbouring table, relate some abominable things about Denise, the way
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.447#in which she had “hooked” the governor, by pulling her dress up whenever
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.448#she went upstairs in front of him. He had with difficulty restrained
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.449#himself from striking him. Then, as the other went off, saying that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.450#the young girl went down every night to join her lover, he called him a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.451#liar, feeling mad with rage.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.452#“What a blackguard! It's a lie, it's a lie, I tell you!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.453#And in the emotion which was agitating him, he let out too much, with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.454#stammering voice, entirely opening his heart.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.455#“I know her, and it isn't true. She has never had any affection except
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.456#for one man; yes, for Monsieur Hutin, and even he has never noticed it,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.457#he can't even boast of ever having as much as touched her.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.458#The report of this quarrel, exaggerated, misconstrued, was already
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.459#affording amusement for the whole shop, when the story of Mouret's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.460#letter was circulated. In fact, it was to a salesman in the silk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.461#department that Liénard first confided the news. With the silk-vendors
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.462#the stock-taking was going on rapidly. Favier and two shopmen, mounted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.463#on stools, were emptying the shelves, passing the pieces of stuff to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.464#Hutin as they went on, the latter, standing on a table, calling out the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.465#figures, after consulting the tickets; and he then dropped the pieces,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.466#which, rising slowly like an autumn tide, were gradually encumbering the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.467#floor. Other men were writing, Albert Lhomme was also helping them,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.468#his face pale and heavy after a night spent in a low public-house at La
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.469#Chapelle. A ray of sun fell from the glazed roof of the hall, through
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.470#which could be seen the ardent blue of the sky.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.471#“Draw those blinds!” cried out Bouthemont, very busy superintending the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.472#work. “The sun is unbearable!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.473#Favier, who was stretching to reach a piece, grumbled under his breath:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.474#“A nice thing to shut people up a lovely day like this! No fear of it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.475#raining on a stock-taking day! And they keep us under lock and key like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.476#a lot of convicts when all Paris is out-doors!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.477#He passed the piece to Hutin. On the ticket was the measurement,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.478#diminished at each sale by the quantity sold, which greatly simplified
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.479#the work. The second-hand cried out: “Fancy silk, small check,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.480#twenty-one yards, at six francs and a half.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.481#And the silk went to increase the heap on the floor. Then he continued
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.482#a conversation commenced, by saying to Favier: “So he wanted to fight
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.483#you?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.484#“Yes, I was quietly drinking my glass of beer. It was hardly worth
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.485#while contradicting me, she has just received a letter from the governor
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.486#inviting her to dinner. The whole shop is talking about it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.487#“What! it wasn't done!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.488#Favier handed him another piece.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.489#“A caution, isn't it? One would have staked his life on it. It seemed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.490#like an old connection.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.491#“Ditto, twenty-five yards!” cried Hutin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.492#The dull thud of the piece was heard, whilst he added in a lower tone:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.493#“She carried on fearfully, you know, at that old fool Bourras's.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.494#The whole department was now joking about the affair, without, however,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.495#allowing the work to suffer. The young girl's name passed from mouth to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.496#mouth, the fellows arched their backs and winked. Bouthemont himself,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.497#who took a rare delight in such gay stories, could not help adding his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.498#joke, the bad taste of which filled his heart with joy. Albert,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.499#waking up a bit, swore he had seen Denise with two soldiers at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.500#Gros-Caillou. At that moment Mignot came down, with the twenty francs he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.501#had just borrowed, and he stopped to slip ten francs into Albert's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.502#hand, making an appointment with him for the evening; a projected lark,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.503#restrained for want of money, but still possible, notwithstanding the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.504#smallness of the sum. But handsome Mignot, when he heard about the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.505#famous letter, made such an abominable remark, that Bouthemont was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.506#obliged to interfere.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.507#“That's enough, gentlemen. It isn't our business. Go on, Monsiéur
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.508#Hutin.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.509#“Fancy silk, small check, thirty-two yards, at six francs and a half,”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.510# cried out the latter.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.511#The pens started off again, the parcels fell regularly, the flood of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.512#stuffs still increased, as if the overflow of a river had emptied itself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.513#there. And the calling out of the fancy silks never ceased. Favier, in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.514#half whisper, remarked that the stock was in a nice state; the governors
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.515#would be enchanted; that big stupid of a Bouthemont might be the best
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.516#buyer in Paris, but as a salesman he was not worth his salt. Hutin
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.517#smiled, delighted, approving by a friendly look; for after having
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.518#himself introduced Bouthemont into The Ladies' Paradise, in order to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.519#drive out Robineau, he was now undermining him also, with the firm
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.520#intention of robbing him of his place. It was the same war as formerly,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.521#treacherous insinuations whispered in the partners' ears, an excessive
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.522#display of zeal in order to push one's-self forward, a regular campaign
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.523#carried on with affable cunning. However, Favier, towards whom Hutin was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.524#displaying some fresh condescension, took a look at the latter, thin and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.525#cold, with his bilious face, as if to count the mouthfuls in this short,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.526#squat little man, and looking as though he were waiting till his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.527#comrade had swallowed up Bouthemont, in order to eat him afterwards.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.528#He, Favier,' hoped to get the second-hand's place, should his friend be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.529#appointed manager. Then, they would see. And both, consumed by the fever
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.530#which was raging from one end of the shop to the other, talked of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.531#probable rises of salary, without ceasing to call out the stock of fancy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.532#silks; they felt sure Bouthemont would reach thirty thousand francs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.533#that year; Hutin would exceed ten thousand; Favier estimated his pay and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.534#commission at five thousand five hundred. The amount of business in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.535#department was increasing yearly, the salesmen were promoted and their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.536#salaries doubled, like officers in time of war.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.537#“Won't those fancy silks soon be finished?” asked Bouthemont suddenly,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.538#with an annoyed air. “What a miserable spring, always raining! People
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.539#have bought nothing but black silks.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.540#His fat, jovial face became cloudy; he looked at the growing heap on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.541#floor, whilst Hutin called out louder still, in a sonorous voice, not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.542#free from triumph--“Fancy silks, small check, twenty-eight yards, at six
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.543#francs and a half.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.544#There was still another shelf-full. Favier, whose arms were beginning
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.545#to feel tired, was now going very slowly. As he handed Hutin the last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.546#pieces he resumed in a low tone--“Oh! I say, I forgot. Have you heard
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.547#that the second-hand in the ready-made department once had a regular
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.548#fancy for you?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.549#The young man seemed greatly surprised. “What! How do you mean?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.550#“Yes, that great booby Deloche let it out to us. I remember her casting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.551#sheep's eyes at you some time back.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.552#Since his appointment as second-hand Hutin had thrown up his music-hall
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.553#singers and gone in for governesses. Greatly flattered at heart, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.554#replied with a scornful air, “I like them a little better stuffed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.555#my boy; besides, it won't do to take up with anybody, as the governor
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.556#does.” He stopped to call out--
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.557#“White Poult silk, thirty-five yards, at eight francs fifteen sous.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.558#“Oh! at last!” murmured Bouthemont, greatly relieved.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.559#But a bell rang, it was the second table, to which Favier belonged. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.560#got off the stool, another salesman took his place, and he was obliged
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.561#to step over the mountain of pieces of stuff with which the floor was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.562#encumbered. Similar heaps were scattered about in very department; the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.563#shelves, the boxes, the cupboards were being gradually emptied, whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.564#the goods were overflowing on every side, under-foot, between the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.565#counters and the tables, in a continual rising. In the linen department
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.566#was heard the heavy falling of the bales of calico; in the mercery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.567#department there was a clicking of boxes; and distant rumbling sounds
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.568#came from the furniture department. Every sort of voice was heard
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.569#together, shrill voices, thick voices; figures whizzed through the air,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.570#a rustling clamour reigned in the immense nave--the clamour of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.571#forests in January when the wind is whistling through the branches.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.572#Favier at last got clear and went up the dining-room staircase. Since
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.573#the enlargement of The Ladies' Paradise the refectories had been shifted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.574#to the fourth storey in the new buildings. As he hurried up he came upon
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.575#Deloche and Liénard, so he fell back on Mignot, who was following on his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.576#heels.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.577#“The deuce!” said he, in the corridor leading to the kitchen, opposite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.578#the blackboard on which the bill of fare was inscribed, “you can see
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.579#it's stock-taking day. A regular feast! Chicken, or leg of mutton, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.580#artichokes! Their mutton won't be much of a success!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.581#Mignot sniggered, murmuring, “Every one's going in for chicken, then!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.582#However, Deloche and Liénard had taken their portions and had gone away.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.583#Favier then leant over at the wicket and called out--“Chicken!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.584#But he had to wait; one of the kitchen helps had cut his finger in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.585#carving, and this caused some confusion. Favier stood there, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.586#his face to the opening, looking into the kitchen with its giant
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.587#appliances--the central range, over which two rails fixed to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.588#ceiling brought forward, by a system of chains and pullies, the colossal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.589#coppers, which four men could not have lifted. Several cooks, quite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.590#white in the sombre red of the furnace, were attending to the evening
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.591#soup coppers, mounted on iron ladders, armed with skimmers fixed on long
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.592#handles. Then against the wall were grills large enough to roast
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.593#martyrs on, saucepans big enough to cook a whole sheep in, a monumental
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.594#plate-warmer, and a marble well kept full by a continual stream of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.595#water. To the left could be seen a washing-up place, stone sinks as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.596#large as ponds; whilst on the other side to the right, was an immense
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.597#meat-safe, in which some large joints of red meat were hanging on steel
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.598#hooks. A machine for peeling potatoes was working with the tic-tac of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.599#a mill. Two small trucks laden with freshly-picked salad were being
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.600#wheeled along by some kitchen helps into the fresh air under a fountain.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.601#“Chicken,” repeated Favier, getting impatient. Then, turning round, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.602#added in a lower tone, “There's one fellow cut himself. It's disgusting,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.603#it's running over the food.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.604#Mignot wanted to see. Quite a string of shopmen had now arrived; there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.605#was a good deal of laughing and pushing. The two young men, their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.606#heads at the wicket, exchanged their remarks before this phalansterian
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.607#kitchen, in which the least utensils, even the spits and larding pins,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.608#assumed gigantic proportions. Two thousand luncheons and two thousand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.609#dinners had to be served, and the number of employees was increasing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.610#every week. It was quite an abyss, into which was thrown daily something
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.611#like forty-five bushels of potatoes, one hundred and twenty pounds of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.612#butter, and sixteen hundred pounds of meat; and at each meal they had to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.613#broach three casks of wine, over a hundred and fifty gallons were served
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.614#out at the wine counter.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.615#“Ah! at last!” murmured Favier when the cook reappeared with a large
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.616#pan, out of which he handed him the leg of a fowl.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.617#“Chicken,” said Mignot behind him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.618#And with their plates in their hands they both entered the refectory,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.619#after having taken their wine at the counter; whilst behind them the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.620#word “Chicken” was repeated without ceasing, regularly, and one could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.621#hear the cook picking up the pieces with his fork with a rapid and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.622#measured sound.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.623#The men's dining-room was now an immense apartment, where places for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.624#five hundred at each of the three dinners could easily be laid. There
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.625#were long mahogany tables, placed parallel across the room, and at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.626#either end were similar tables reserved for the managers of departments
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.627#and the inspectors; whilst in the centre was a counter for the extras.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.628#Large windows, right and left, lighted up with a white light this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.629#gallery, of which the ceiling, notwithstanding its being four yards
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.630#high, seemed very low, crushed by the enormous development of the other
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.631#dimensions. The sole ornament on the walls, painted a light yellow,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.632#were the napkin cupboards. After this first refectory came that of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.633#the messengers and carmen, where the meals were served irregularly,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.634#according to the necessities of the work.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.635#“What! you've got a leg as well, Mignot?” said Favier, as he took his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.636#place at one of the tables opposite his companion.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.637#Other young men now sat down around them. There was no tablecloth, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.638#plates gave out a cracked sound on the bare mahogany, and every one was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.639#crying out in this particular corner, for the number of legs was really
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.640#prodigious.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.641#“These chickens are all legs!” remarked Mignot.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.642#Those who had pieces of the carcase were greatly discontented. However,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.643#the food had been much better since the late improvements. Mouret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.644#no longer treated with a contractor at a fixed sum; he had taken the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.645#kitchen into his own hands, organising it like one of the departments,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.646#with a head-cook, under-cooks, and an inspector; and if he spent more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.647#he got more work out of the staff--a practical humane calculation which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.648#long terrified Bourdoncle.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.649#“Mine is pretty tender, all the same,” said Mignot. “Pass over the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.650#bread!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.651#The big loaf was sent round, and after cutting a slice for himself he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.652#dug the knife into the crust A few dilatory ones now hurried in, taking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.653#their places; a ferocious appetite, increased by the morning's work,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.654#ran along the immense tables from one end to the other. There was an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.655#increasing clatter of forks, a sound of bottles being emptied, the noise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.656#of glasses laid down too violently, the grinding rumble of five hundred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.657#pairs of powerful jaws working with wonderful energy. And the talk,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.658#still very rare, was stifled in the mouths full of food.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.659#Deloche, however, seated between Bauge and Liénard, found himself nearly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.660#opposite Favier. They had glanced at each other with a rancorous look.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.661#The neighbours whispered, aware of their quarrel the previous day.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.662#Then they laughed at poor Deloche's ill-luck, always famishing, always
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.663#falling on to the worst piece at table, by a sort of cruel fatality.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.664#This time he had come in for the neck of a chicken and bits of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.665#carcase. Without saying a word he let them joke away, swallowing large
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.666#mouthfuls of bread, and picking the neck with the infinite art of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.667#fellow who entertains a great respect for meat.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.668#“Why don't you complain?” asked Bauge.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.669#But he shrugged his shoulders. What would be the good? It was always the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.670#same. When he ventured to complain things went worse than ever.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.671#“You know the Bobbin fellows have got their club now,” said Mignot, all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.672#at once. “Yes, my boy, the 'Bobbin Club.' It's held at a tavern in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.673#Rue Saint-Honoré, where they hire a room on Saturdays.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.674#He was speaking of the mercery salesmen. The whole table began to joke.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.675#Between two mouthfuls, with his voice still thick, each one made some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.676#remark, added a detail; the obstinate readers alone remained mute,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.677#absorbed, their noses buried in some newspapers. It could not be denied;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.678#shopmen were gradually assuming a better style; nearly half of them now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.679#spoke English or German. It was no longer good form to go and kick up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.680#a row at Bullier, to prowl about the music-halls for the pleasure of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.681#hissing ugly singers. No; a score of them got together and formed a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.682#club.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.683#“Have they a piano like the linen-drapers?” asked Liénard.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.684#“I should rather think they have a piano!” exclaimed Mignot. “And they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.685#play, my boy, and sing! There's even one of them, little Bavoux, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.686#recites verses.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.687#The gaiety redoubled, they chaffed little Bavoux, but still beneath this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.688#laughter there lay a great respect. They then spoke of a piece at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.689#Vaudeville, in which a counter-jumper played a nasty part, which annoyed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.690#several of them, whilst others were anxiously wondering what time they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.691#would get away, having invitations to pass the evening at friends'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.692#houses; and from all points were heard similar conversations amidst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.693#the increasing noise of the crockery. To drive out the odour of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.694#food--the warm steam which rose from the five hundred plates--the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.695#windows had been opened, while the lowered blinds were scorching in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.696#the heavy August sun. An ardent breath came in from the street, golden
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.697#reflections yellowed the ceiling, bathing in a reddish light the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.698#perspiring eaters.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.699#“A nice thing to shut people up such a fine Sunday as this!” repeated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.700#Favier.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.701#This reflection brought them back to the stock-taking. It was a splendid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.702#year. And they went on to speak of the salaries--the rises--the eternal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.703#subject, the stirring question which occupied them all. It was always
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.704#thus on chicken days, a wonderful excitement declared itself, the noise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.705#at last became insupportable. When the waiters brought the artichokes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.706#one could not hear one's self speak. The inspector on duty had orders to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.707#be indulgent.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.708#“By the way,” cried out Favier, “you've heard the news?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.709#But his voice was drowned. Mignot was asking: “Who doesn't like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.710#artichoke; I'll sell my dessert for an artichoke.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.711#No one replied. Everybody liked artichoke. This lunch would be counted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.712#amongst the good ones, for peaches were to be given for dessert.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.713#“He has invited her to dinner, my dear fellow,” said Favier to his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.714#right-hand neighbour, finishing his story. “What! you didn't know it?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.715#The whole table knew it, they were tired of talking about it since the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.716#first thing in the morning. And the same poor jokes passed from mouth
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.717#to mouth. Deloche had turned pale again. He looked at them, his eyes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.718#finishing by resting on Favier, who was persisting in repeating:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.719#“If he's not had her, he's going to. And he won't be the first; oh! no,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.720#he won't be the first.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.721#He was also looking at Deloche. He added with a provoking air: “Those
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.722#who like bones can have her for a crown!” Suddenly, he ducked his head.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.723#Deloche, yielding to an irresistible movement, had just thrown his last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.724#glass of wine into his tormentor's face, stammering: “Take that, you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.725#infernal liar! I ought to have drenched you yesterday!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.726#[Illustration: 0406]
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.727#It caused quite a scandal. A few drops had spurted on Favier's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.728#neighbours, whilst he only had his hair slightly wetted: the wine,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.729#thrown by an awkward hand, had fallen the other side of the table. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.730#the others got angry, asking if she was his mistress that he defended
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.731#her in this way? What a brute! he deserved a good sound drubbing to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.732#teach him manners. However, their voices fell, an inspector was observed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.733#coming along, and it was useless to introduce the management into the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.734#quarrel. Favier contented himself with saying:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.735#“If it had caught me, you would have seen some sport!” Then the affair
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.736#wound up in jeers. When Deloche, still trembling, wished to drink to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.737#hide his confusion, and seized his empty glass mechanically, they burst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.738#out laughing. He laid his glass down again awkwardly, and commenced
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.739#sucking the leaves of the artichoke he had already eaten.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.740#“Pass Deloche the water bottle,” said Mignot, quietly; “he's thirsty.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.741#The laughter increased. The young men took their clean plates from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.742#piles standing on the table, at equal distances, whilst the waiters
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.743#handed round the dessert, which consisted of peaches, in baskets. And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.744#they all held their sides when Mignot added, with a grin:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.745#“Each man to his taste. Deloche takes wine with his peaches.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.746#The latter sat motionless, with his head hanging down, as if deaf to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.747#joking going on around him: he was full of a despairing regret for what
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.748#he had just done. These fellows were right--what right had he to defend
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.749#her? They would now think all sorts of villanous things: he could have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.750#killed himself for having thus compromised her, in attempting to prove
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.751#her innocence. This was always his luck, he might just as well kill
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.752#himself at once, for he could not even yield to the promptings of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.753#heart without doing some stupid thing. And the fears came into his eyes.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.754#Was it not always his fault if the whole shop was talking of the letter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.755#written by the governor? He heard them grinning and making abominable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.756#remarks about this invitation, of which Liénard alone had been informed;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.757#and he accused himself, he ought not to have let Pauline speak before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.758#the latter; he was really responsible for the annoying indiscretion
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.759#committed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.760#“Why did you go and relate that?” he murmured at last, in a voice full
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.761#of grief. “It's very bad.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.762#“I?” replied Liénard; “but I only told it to one or two persons,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.763#enjoining secrecy. One never knows how these things get about!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.764#When Deloche made up his mind to drink a glass of water the whole table
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.765#burst out laughing again. They had finished and were lolling back on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.766#their chairs waiting for the bell recalling them to work. They had not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.767#asked for many extras at the great central counter, the more so as the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.768#firm treated them to coffee that day. The cups were steaming, perspiring
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.769#faces shone under the light vapours, floating like the blue clouds
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.770#from cigarettes. At the windows the blinds hung motionless, without the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.771#slightest flapping. One of them, drawn up, admitted a ray of sunshine
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.772#which traversed the room and gilded the ceiling. The uproar of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.773#voices beat on the walls with such force that the bell was at first
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.774#only heard by those at the tables near the door. They got up, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.775#the confusion of the departure filled the corridors for a long time.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.776#Deloche, however, remained behind to escape the malicious remarks that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.777#were still being made. Baugé even went out before him, and Baugé was, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.778#a rule, the last to leave, going a circuitous way so as to meet Pauline
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.779#as she went to the ladies' dining-room; a manouvre arranged between
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.780#them--the only chance of seeing each other for a minute during business
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.781#hours. But this time, just as they were indulging in a loving kiss in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.782#corner of the passage they were surprised by Denise, who was also going
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.783#up to lunch. She was walking slowly on account of her foot.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.784#“Oh! my dear,” stammered Pauline, very red, “don't say anything, will
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.785#you?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.786#Baugé, with his big limbs and giant proportions, was trembling like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.787#a little boy. He murmured, “They'd very soon pitch us out. Though our
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.788#marriage may be announced, they don't allow any kissing, the animals!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.789#Denise, greatly agitated, affected not to have seen them; and Baugé
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.790#disappeared just as Deloche, who was going the longest way round,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.791#appeared in his turn. He tried to apologise, stammering out phrases that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.792#Denise did not at first catch. Then, as he blamed Pauline for having
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.793#spoken before Liénard, and she stood there looking very embarrassed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.794#Denise at last understood the whispered phrases she had heard around her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.795#all the morning. It was the story of the letter that was circulating.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.796#She was again seized by the shudder with which this letter had agitated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.797#her; she felt herself disrobed by all these men.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.798#“But I didn't know,” repeated Pauline. “Besides, there's nothing bad in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.799#the letter. Let them gossip; they're jealous, of course!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.800#“My dear,” said Denise at last, with her prudent air, “I don't blame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.801#you in any way! You've spoken nothing but the truth. I _have_ received a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.802#letter, and it is my duty to answer it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.803#Deloche went away heart-broken, having understood that the young girl
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.804#accepted the situation and would keep the appointment that evening. When
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.805#the two young ladies had lunched in a small room adjoining the large
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.806#dining-room, and in which the women were served much more comfortably,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.807#Pauline had to assist Denise downstairs, for the latter's foot was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.808#worse.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.809#Down below in the afternoon warmth the stock-taking was roaring louder
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.810#than ever. The moment for the supreme effort had arrived, when before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.811#the work, behindhand since the morning, every force was put forth in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.812#order to finish that evening. The voices got louder still, one saw
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.813#nothing but the waving of arms continually emptying the shelves,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.814#throwing the goods down, and it was impossible to get along, the tide of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.815#the bales and piles of goods on the floor rose as high as the counters.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.816#A sea of heads, of brandished fists, of limbs flying about, seemed to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.817#extend to the very depths of the departments, like the distant confusion
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.818#of a riot. It was the last fever of the clearance, the machine nearly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.819#ready to burst; whilst along the plate-glass windows, round the closed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.820#shop, a few rare pedestrians continued to pass, pale with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.821#stifling boredom of a summer Sunday. On the pavement in the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.822#Neuve-Saint-Augustin were planted three tall girls, bareheaded and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.823#sluttish-looking, impudently sticking their faces against the windows,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.824#trying to see the curious work going on inside.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.825#When Denise returned to the ready-made department Madame Aurélie left
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.826#Marguerite to finish calling out the garments. There was still a lot of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.827#checking to be done, for which, desirous of silence, she retired into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.828#the pattern-room, taking the young girl with her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.829#“Come with me, we'll do the checking; then you can add up the totals.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.830#But as she wished to leave the door open, in order to look after the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.831#young ladies, the noise came in, and they could not hear much better.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.832#It was a large, square room, furnished simply with some chairs and three
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.833#long tables. In one corner were the great machine knives, for cutting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.834#up the patterns. Entire pieces were consumed; they sent away every year
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.835#more than sixty thousand francs' worth of material, cut up in strips.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.836#From morning to night, the knives were cutting up silk, wool, and linen,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.837#with a scythe-like noise. Then the books had to be got together,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.838#gummed or sewn. And there was also between the two windows, a little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.839#printing-press for the tickets.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.840#“Not so loud, please!” cried Madame Aurélie, now and again, quite unable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.841#to hear Denise reading out the articles.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.842#When the checking of the first lists was finished, she left the young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.843#girl at one of the tables, absorbed in the adding-up. But she returned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.844#almost immediately, and placed Mademoiselle de Fontenailles near her;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.845#the under-linen department not wanting her any longer, had sent her to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.846#Madame Aurélie. She could also do some adding-up, it would save time.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.847#But the appearance of the marchioness, as Clara ill-naturedly called
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.848#her, had disturbed the department. They laughed and joked at poor
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.849#Joseph, their ferocious sallies could be heard in the pattern-room.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.850#“Don't draw back, you are not at all in my way,” said Denise, seized
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.851#with pity for the poor girl. “My inkstand will suffice, we'll dip
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.852#together.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.853#Mademoiselle de Fontenailles, dulled and stultified by her unfortunate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.854#position, could not even find a word of gratitude. She appeared to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.855#a woman who drank, her thinness had a livid appearance, and her hands
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.856#alone, white and delicate, attested the distinction of her birth.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.857#The laughter ceased all at once, and the work resumed its regular roar.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.858#It was Mouret who was once more going through the departments. But he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.859#stopped and looked round for Denise, surprised not to see her there.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.860#He made a sign to Madame Aurélie; and both drew aside, talking in a low
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.861#tone for a moment. He must be questioning her. She indicated with her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.862#eyes the pattern-room, then seemed to be making a report. No doubt she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.863#was relating that the young girl had been weeping that morning.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.864#“Very good!” said Mouret, aloud, coming nearer. “Show me the lists.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.865#“This way, sir,” said the first-hand. “We have run away from the noise.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.866#He followed her into the next room. Clara was not duped by this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.867#manouvre, and said they had better go and fetch a bed at once. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.868#Marguerite threw her the garments at a quicker rate, in order to take
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.869#up her attention and close her mouth. Wasn't the second-hand a good
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.870#comrade? Her affairs did not concern any one. The department was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.871#becoming an accomplice, the young ladies got more agitated than ever,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.872#Lhomme and Joseph affected not to see or hear anything. And Jouve,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.873#the inspector, who, passing by, had remarked Madame Aurélie's tactics,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.874#commenced walking up and down before the pattern-room door, with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.875#regular step of a sentry guarding the will and pleasure of a superior.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.876#“Give Monsieur Mouret the lists,” said the first-hand.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.877#Denise gave them, and sat there with her eyes raised. She had slightly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.878#started, but had conquered herself, and retained a fine calm look,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.879#although her cheeks were pale. For a moment, Mouret appeared to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.880#absorbed in the list of articles, without a look for the young girl.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.881#A silence reigned, Madame Aurélie then went up to Mademoiselle de
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.882#Fontenailles, who had not even turned her head, appeared dissatisfied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.883#with her counting, and said to her in a half whisper:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.884#“Go and help with the parcels. You are not used to figures.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.885#The latter got up, and returned to the department, where she was greeted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.886#by a whispering on all sides. Joseph, exposed to the laughing eyes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.887#of these young minxes, was writing anyhow. Clara, delighted with this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.888#assistant who arrived, was yet very rough with her, hating her as she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.889#hated all the women in the shop. What an idiotic thing to yield to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.890#love of a workman, when one was a marchioness! And yet she envied her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.891#this love.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.892#“Very good!” repeated Mouret, still affecting to read.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.893#However Madame Aurélie hardly knew how to get away in her turn in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.894#decent fashion. She stamped about, went to look at the knives, furious
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.895#with her husband for not inventing a pretext for calling her; but he was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.896#never any good for serious matters, he would have died of thirst close
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.897#to a pond. It was Marguerite who was intelligent enough to go and ask
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.898#the first-hand a question.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.899#“I'm coming,” replied the latter.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.900#And her dignity being now protected, having a pretext in the eyes of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.901#young ladies who were watching her, she at last left Denise and Mouret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.902#alone together, going out with her imperial air, her profile so noble,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.903#that the saleswomen did not even dare to smile. Mouret had slowly laid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.904#the lists on the table, and stood looking at the young girl, who had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.905#remained seated, pen in hand. She did not avert her gaze, but she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.906#turned paler.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.907#“You will come this evening?” asked he.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.908#“No, sir, I cannot. My brothers are to be at uncle's to-night, and I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.909#have promised to dine with them.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.910#“But your foot! You walk with such difficulty.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.911#“Oh, I can get so far very well. I feel much better since the morning.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.912#He had now turned pale in his turn, before this quiet refusal. A nervous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.913#revolt agitated his lips. However, he restrained himself, and resumed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.914#with the air of a good-natured master simply interesting himself in one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.915#of his young ladies: “Come now, if I begged of you--You know what great
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.916#esteem I have for you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.917#Denise retained her respectful attitude. “I am greatly touched, sir, by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.918#your kindness to me, and I thank you for this invitation. But I repeat,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.919#I cannot; my brothers expect me.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.920#She persisted in not understanding. The door remained open, and she felt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.921#that the whole shop was pushing her on to yield. Pauline had amicably
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.922#called her a great simpleton, the others would laugh at her if she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.923#refused the invitation. Madame Aurélie, who had gone away, Marguerite,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.924#whose rising voice she could hear, Lhomme, with his motionless, discreet
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.925#attitude, all these people were wishing for her fall, throwing her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.926#into the governor's arms. And the distant roar of the stock-taking,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.927#the millions of goods called out on all sides, thrown about in every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.928#direction, were like a warm wind, carrying the breath of passion
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.929#straight towards her. There was a silence. Now and again, Mouret's voice
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.930#was drowned by the noise which accompanied him, with the formidable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.931#uproar of a kingly fortune gained in battle.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.932#“When will you come, then?” asked he again. “Tomorrow?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.933#This simple question troubled Denise. She lost her calmness for a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.934#moment, and stammered: “I don't know--I can't----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.935#He smiled, and tried to take her hand, which she withheld. “What are you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.936#afraid of?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.937#But she quickly raised her head, looked him straight in the face, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.938#said, smiling, with her sweet, brave look: “I am afraid of nothing, sir.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.939#I can do as I like, can't I? I don't wish to, that's all!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.940#As she finished speaking, she was surprised by hearing a creaking noise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.941#and on turning round saw the door slowly closing. It was Jouve, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.942#inspector, who had taken upon himself to pull it to. The doors were a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.943#part of his duty, none should ever remain open. And he gravely resumed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.944#his position as sentinel. No one appeared to have noticed this door
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.945#being closed in such a simple manner. Clara alone risked a strong remark
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.946#in Mademoiselle de Fontenailles's ear, but the latter's face remained
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.947#expressionless.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.948#Denise, however, had got up. Mouret was saying to her in a low and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.949#trembling voice: “Listen, Denise, I love you. You have long known it,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.950#pray don't be so cruel as to play the ignorant. And don't fear anything.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.951#Many a time I've thought of calling you into my office. We should have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.952#been alone, I should only have had to lock the door. But I did not wish
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.953#to; you see I speak to you here, where any one can enter. I love you,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.954#Denise!” She was standing up, very pale, listening to him, still looking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.955#straight into his face. “Tell me. Why do you refuse? Have you no wants?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.956#Your brothers are a heavy burden. Anything you might ask me, anything
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.957#you might require of me----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.958#With a word, she stopped him: “Thanks, I now earn more than I want.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.959#“But it's perfect liberty that I am offering you, an existence of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.960#pleasure and luxury. I will set you up in a home of your own. I will
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.961#assure you a little fortune.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.962#“No, thanks; I should soon get tired of doing nothing. I earned my own
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.963#living before I was ten years old.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.964#He was almost mad. This was the first one who did not yield. He had only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.965#had to stoop to pick up the others, they all awaited his pleasure
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.966#like submissive slaves; and this one said no, without even giving a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.967#reasonable pretext. His desire, long restrained, goaded by resistance,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.968#became stronger than ever. Perhaps he had not offered enough, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.969#thought, and he doubled his offers; he pressed her more and more.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.970#“No, no, thanks,” replied she each time, without faltering. Then he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.971#allowed this cry from his heart to escape him: “But don't you see that I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.972#am suffering! Yes, it's stupid, but I am suffering like a child!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.973#Tears came into his eyes. A fresh silence reigned. They could still hear
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.974#behind the closed door the softened roar of the stock-taking. It was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.975#like a dying note of triumph, the accompaniment became more discreet, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.976#this defeat of the master. “And yet if I liked--” said he in an ardent
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.977#voice, seizing her hands.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.978#She left them in his, her eyes turned pale, her whole strength was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.979#deserting her. A warmth came from this man's burning hands, filling her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.980#with a delicious cowardice. Good heavens! how she loved him, and with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.981#what delight she could have hung on his neck and remained there!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.982#“I will! I will!” repeated he, in his passionate excitement “I expect
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.983#you to-night, otherwise I will take measures.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.984#He was becoming brutal. She set up a low cry; the pain she felt at her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.985#wrists restored her courage. With an angry shake she disengaged herself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.986#Then, very stiff, looking taller in her weakness: “No, leave me alone!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.987#I am not a Clara, to be thrown over in a day. Besides, you love another;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.988#yes, that lady who comes here. Stay with her. I do not accept half an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.989#affection.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.990#He was struck with surprise. What was she saying, and what did she want?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.991#The girls he had picked up in the shop had never asked to be loved. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.992#ought to have laughed at such an idea, and this attitude of tender pride
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.993#completely conquered his heart.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.994#“Now, sir, please open the door,” resumed she. “It is not proper to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.995#shut up together in this way.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.996#He obeyed; and with his temples throbbing, hardly knowing how to conceal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.997#his anguish, he recalled Madame Aurélie, and broke out angrily about the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.998#stock of cloaks, saying that the prices must be lowered, until every one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.999#had been got rid of. Such was the rule of the house--a clean sweep was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1000#made every year, they sold at sixty per cent, loss rather than keep an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1001#old model or any stale material. At that moment, Bourdoncle, seeking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1002#Mouret, was waiting for him outside, stopped before the closed door
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1003#by Jouve, who had said a word in his ear with a grave air. He got very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1004#impatient, without, however, summoning up the courage to interrupt the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1005#governor's tête-à-tête. Was it possible? such a day too, and with that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1006#puny creature! And when Mouret at last came out Bourdoncle spoke to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1007#him about the fancy silks, of which the stock left on hand would be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1008#enormous. This was a relief for Mouret, who could now cry out at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1009#his ease. What the devil was Bouthemont thinking about? He went off,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1010#declaring that he could not allow a buyer to display such a want of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1011#sense as to buy beyond the requirements of the business.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1012#“What is the matter with him?” murmured Madame Aurélie, quite overcome
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1013#by his reproaches.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1014#And the young ladies looked at each other with a surprised air. At six
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1015#o'clock the stock-taking was finished. The sun was still shining--a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1016#blonde summer sun, of which the golden reflection streamed through
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1017#the glazed roofs of the halls. In the heavy air of the streets, tired
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1018#families were already returning from the suburbs, loaded with bouquets,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1019#dragging their children along. One by one, the departments had become
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1020#silent. Nothing was now heard in the depths of the galleries but the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1021#lingering calls of a few men clearing a last shelf. Then even these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1022#voices ceased, and there remained of the bustle of the day nothing but a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1023#shivering, above the formidable piles of goods. The shelves, cupboards,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1024#boxes, and band-boxes, were now empty: not a yard of stuff, not an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1025#object of any sort had remained in its place. The vast establishment
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1026#presented nothing but the carcase of its usual appearance, the woodwork
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1027#was absolutely bare, as on the day of entering into possession. This
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1028#nakedness was the visible proof of the complete and exact taking of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1029#stock. And on the ground was sixteen million francs' worth of goods, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1030#rising sea, which had finished by submerging the tables and counters.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1031#The shopmen, drowned up to the shoulders, had commenced to put each
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1032#article back into its place. They expected to finish about ten o'clock.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1033#When Madame Aurélie, who went to the first dinner, returned to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1034#dining-room, she announced the amount of business done during the year,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1035#which the totals of the various departments had just given. The figure
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1036#was eighty million francs, ten millions more than the preceding year.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1037#The only real decrease was on the fancy silks.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1038#“If Monsieur Mouret is not satisfied, I should like to know what more he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1039#wants,” added the first-hand. “See! he's over there, at the top of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1040#grand staircase, looking furious.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1041#The young ladies went to look at him. He was standing alone, with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1042#sombre countenance, above the millions scattered at his feet.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1043#“Madame,” said Denise, at this moment, “would you kindly let me go away
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1044#now? I can't do any more good on account of my foot, and as I am to dine
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1045#at my uncle's with my brothers----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1046#They were all astonished. She had not yielded, then! Madame Aurélie
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1047#hesitated, and seemed inclined to prohibit her going out, her voice
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1048#sharp and disagreeable; whilst Clara shrugged her shoulders, full of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1049#incredulity. That wouldn't do! it was very simple--the governor no
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1050#longer wanted her! When Pauline learnt this, she was in the baby-linen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1051#department with Deloche, and the sudden joy exhibited by the young man
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1052#made her very angry. That did him a lot of good, didn't it? Perhaps
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1053#he was pleased to see that his friend had been stupid enough to miss
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1054#a fortune? And Bourdoncle, who did not dare to approach Mouret in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1055#his ferocious isolation, marched up and down amidst these rumours, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1056#despair also, and full of anxiety. However, Denise went downstairs. As
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1057#she arrived at the bottom of the left-hand staircase, slowly, supporting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1058#herself by the banister, she came upon a group of grinning salesmen.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1059#Her name was pronounced, and she felt that they were talking about her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1060#adventure. They had not noticed her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1061#“Oh! all that's put on, you know,” Favier was saying. “She's full of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1062#vice! Yes, I know some one she wanted to take by force.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1063#And he looked at Hutin, who, in order to preserve his dignity as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1064#second-hand, was standing a certain distance apart, without joining
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1065#in their conversation. But he was so flattered by the air of envy with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1066#which the others were contemplating him, that he deigned to murmur: “She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1067#was a regular nuisance to me, that girl!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1068#Denise, wounded to the heart, clung to the banister. They must have seen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1069#her, for they all disappeared, laughing. He was right, she thought,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1070#and she accused herself of her former ignorance, when she used to think
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1071#about him. But what a coward he was, and how she scorned him now! A
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1072#great trouble had seized her: was it not strange that she should have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1073#found the strength just now to repulse a man whom she adored, when she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1074#used to feel herself so feeble in bygone days before this worthless
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1075#fellow, whom she had only dreamed off? Her sense of reason and her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1076#bravery foundered before these contradictions of her being, in which she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1077#could not read clearly. She hastened to cross the hall. Then a sort of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1078#instinct prompted her to raise her head, whilst an inspector opened the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1079#door, closed since the morning. And she perceived Mouret, who was still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1080#at the top of the stairs, on the great central landing, dominating
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1081#the gallery. But he had forgotten the stock-taking, he did not see his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1082#empire, this building bursting with riches. Everything had disappeared,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1083#his former glorious victories, his future colossal fortune. With a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1084#desponding look he was watching Denise's departure, and when she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:x.1085#passed the door everything disappeared, a darkness came over the house.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.1#CHAPTER XI.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.2#That day Bouthemont was the first to arrive at Madame Desforges's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.3#four o'clock tea. Still alone in her large Louis XVI. drawing-room,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.4#the brasses and brocatelle of which shone out with a clear gaiety, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.5#latter rose with an air of impatience, saying, “Well?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.6#“Well,” replied the young man, “when I told him I should doubtless call
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.7#on you he formally promised me to come.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.8#“You made him thoroughly understand that I counted on the baron to-day?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.9#“Certainly. That's what appeared to decide him.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.10#They were speaking of Mouret, who the year before had suddenly taken
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.11#such a liking to Bouthemont that he had admitted him to share his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.12#pleasures, and had even introduced him to Henriette, glad to have an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.13#agreeable fellow always at hand to enliven an intimacy of which he was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.14#getting tired. It was thus that Bouthemont had ultimately become the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.15#confidant of his governor and of the handsome widow; he did their little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.16#errands, talked of the one to the other, and sometimes reconciled them.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.17#Henriette, in her jealous fits, abandoned herself to a familiarity which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.18#sometimes surprised and embarrassed him, for she lost all her lady-like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.19#prudence, using all her art to save appearances.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.20#She resumed violently, “You ought to have brought him. I should have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.21#been sure then.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.22#“Well,” said he, with a good-natured laugh, “it isn't my fault if he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.23#escapes so frequently now. Oh! he's very fond of me, all the same. Were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.24#it not for him I should be in a bad way at the shop.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.25#His situation at The Ladies' Paradise was really menaced since the last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.26#stock-taking. It was in vain that he adduced the rainy season; one could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.27#not overlook the considerable stock of fancy silks; and as Hutin was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.28#improving the occasion, undermining him with the governors with an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.29#increase of sly rage, he felt the ground cracking under him. Mouret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.30#had condemned him, weary, no doubt, of this witness who prevented him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.31#breaking with Henriette, tired of a familiarity which was profitless.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.32#But, in accordance with his usual tactics, he was pushing Bourdoncle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.33#forward; it was Bourdoncle and the other partners who insisted on his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.34#dismissal at each board meeting; whilst he resisted still, according to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.35#his account, defending his friend energetically, at the risk of getting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.36#into serious trouble with the others.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.37#“Well, I shall wait,” resumed Madame Desforges. “You know that girl is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.38#coming here at five o'clock, I want to see them face to face. I must
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.39#discover their secret.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.40#And she returned to this long-meditated plan. She repeated in her fever
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.41#that she had requested Madame Aurélie to send her Denise to look at a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.42#mantle which fitted badly. When she had once got the young girl in her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.43#room, she would find a means of calling Mouret, and could then act.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.44#Bouthemont, who had sat down opposite her, was gazing at her with his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.45#fine laughing eyes, which he endeavoured to render grave. This jovial,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.46#dissipated fellow, with his coal-black beard, whose warm Gascon blood
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.47#empurpled his cheeks, was thinking that these fine ladies were not much
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.48#good, and that they let out a nice lot of secrets, when they opened
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.49#their hearts. His friend's mistresses, simple shop-girls, certainly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.50#never made more complete confessions.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.51#“Come,” he ventured to say at last, “what does that matter to you? I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.52#swear to you there is nothing whatever between them.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.53#“Just so,” cried she, “because he loves her! I don't care in the least
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.54#for the others, chance acquaintances, friends of a day!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.55#She spoke of Clara with disdain. She was well aware that Mouret, after
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.56#Denise's refusal, had fallen back on this tall, redhaired girl, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.57#the horse's head, doubtless by calculation; for he maintained her in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.58#department, loading her with presents. Not only that, for the last three
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.59#months he had been leading: a terrible life, squandering his money with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.60#a prodigality which caused a great many remarks; he had bought a mansion
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.61#for a worthless actress, and was being ruined by two or three other
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.62#jades, who seemed to be struggling to outdo each other in costly, stupid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.63#caprices.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.64#“It's this creature's fault,” repeated Henriette. “I feel sure he's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.65#ruining himself with the others because she repulses him. Besides,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.66#what's his money to me? I should have loved him better poor. You know
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.67#how I love him, you who have become our friend.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.68#She stopped, choked, ready to burst into tears; and with a movement
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.69#of abandon she held out her two hands to him. It was true, she adored
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.70#Mouret for his youth and his triumphs, never had any man thus conquered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.71#her so entirely in a quiver of her flesh and of her pride; but at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.72#thought of losing him, she also heard the knell of her fortieth year,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.73#and she asked herself with terror how she should replace this great
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.74#love.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.75#“I'll have my revenge,” murmured she. “I'll have my revenge, if he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.76#behaves badly!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.77#Bouthemont continued to hold her hands in his. She was still handsome.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.78#But she would be a very awkward mistress, thought he, and he did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.79#like that style of woman. The thing, however, deserved thinking over;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.80#perhaps it would be worth while risking certain annoyances.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.81#“Why don't you set up for yourself?” she asked all at once, drawing her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.82#hands away.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.83#He was astonished. Then he replied: “But it would require an immense
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.84#sum. Last year I had an idea in my head. I feel convinced that there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.85#are customers enough in Paris for one or two more big shops; but the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.86#district would have to be chosen. The Bon Marche has the left side
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.87#of the river; the Louvre occupies the centre; we monopolise, at The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.88#Paradise, the rich west-end district. There remains the north, where
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.89#a rival to the Place Clichy could be created. And I had discovered a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.90#splendid position, near the Opera House----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.91#“Well?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.92#He set up a noisy laugh. “Just fancy. I was stupid enough to go and talk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.93#to my father about it Yes, I was simple enough to ask him to find some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.94#shareholders at Toulouse.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.95#And he gaily described the anger of the old man, enraged against the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.96#great Parisian bazaars, in his little country shop. Old Bouthemont,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.97#suffocated by the thirty thousand francs a year earned by his son, had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.98#replied that he would give his money and that of his friends to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.99#hospitals rather than contribute a sou to one of those shops which were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.100#the pests of the drapery business.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.101#“Besides,” continued the young man, “it would require millions.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.102#“Suppose they were found?” observed Madame Desforges, simply.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.103#He looked at her, serious all at once. Was it not merely a jealous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.104#woman's word? But she did not give him time to question her, adding: “In
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.105#short, you know what a great interest I take in you. We'll talk about it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.106#again.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.107#The outer bell had rung. She got up, and he, himself, with an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.108#instinctive movement, drew back his chair, as if they might have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.109#been surprised. A silence reigned in the drawingroom, with its pretty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.110#hangings, and decorated with such a profusion of green plants that there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.111#was quite a small wood between the two windows. She stood there waiting,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.112#with her ear towards the door.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.113#“There he is,” she murmured.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.114#The footman announced Monsieur Mouret and Monsieur de Vallagnosc.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.115#Henriette could not restrain a movement of anger. Why had he not come
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.116#alone? He must have gone after his friend, fearful of a tête-à-tête with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.117#her. However, she smiled and shook hands with the two men.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.118#“What a stranger you are getting. I may say the same for you, Monsieur
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.119#de Vallagnosc.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.120#Her great grief was to be becoming stout, and she squeezed herself into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.121#tight black silk dresses, to conceal her increasing obesity. However,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.122#her pretty face, with her dark hair, preserved its amiable expression.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.123#And Mouret could familiarly tell her, enveloping her with a look:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.124#“It's useless to ask how you are. You are as fresh as a rose.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.125#“Oh! I'm almost too well,” replied she. “Besides, I might have died; you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.126#would have known nothing about it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.127#She was examining him also, and thought him looking tired and nervous,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.128#his eyes heavy, his complexion livid.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.129#“Well,” she resumed, in a tone which she endeavoured to render
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.130#agreeable, “I cannot return the compliment; you don't look at all well
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.131#to-day.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.132#“Overwork!” remarked De Vallagnosc.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.133#Mouret shrugged his shoulders, without replying. He had just perceived
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.134#Bouthemont, and nodded to him in a friendly way. During the time
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.135#of their close intimacy he used to take him away direct from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.136#department, bringing him to Henriette's during the busiest moments of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.137#the afternoon. But times had changed; he said to him in a half whisper:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.138#“You went away rather early. They noticed your departure, and are
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.139#furious about it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.140#He referred to Bourdoncle and the other persons who had an interest in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.141#the business, as if he were not himself the master.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.142#“Ah!” murmured Bouthemont, rather anxious.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.143#“Yes, I want to talk to you. Wait for me, we'll leave together.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.144#Meanwhile, Henriette had sat down again; and while listening to De
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.145#Vallagnosc, who was announcing that Madame de Boves would probably pay
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.146#her a visit, she did not take her eyes off Mouret. The latter, silent
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.147#again, gazed at the furniture, seemed to be looking for something on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.148#ceiling. Then as she laughingly complained that she had only gentlemen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.149#at her four o'clock tea, he so far forgot himself as to blurt out:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.150#“I expected to find Baron Hartmann here.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.151#Henriette turned pale. No doubt she knew he came to her house solely to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.152#meet the baron; but he might have avoided throwing his indifference in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.153#her face like this. At that moment the door had opened and the footman
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.154#was standing behind her. When she had interrogated him by a sign, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.155#leant over her and said in a very low tone:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.156#“It's for that mantle. You wished me to let you know. The young lady is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.157#there.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.158#Then Henriette raised her voice, so as to be heard. All her jealous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.159#suffering found relief in the following words, of a scornful harshness:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.160#“She can wait!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.161#“Shall I show her into your dressing-room?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.162#“No, no. Let her stay in the ante-room!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.163#And when the servant had gone out she quietly resumed her conversation
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.164#with De Vallagnosc. Mouret, who had relapsed into his former lassitude,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.165#had listened with a careless, distracted air, without understanding.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.166#Bouthemont, preoccupied by the adventure, was reflecting. But almost
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.167#immediately after the door was opened again, and two ladies were shown
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.168#in.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.169#“Just fancy,” said Madame Marty, “I was alighting at the door, when I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.170#saw Madame de Boves coming under the arcade.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.171#“Yes,” explained the latter, “it's a fine day, and my doctor says I must
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.172#take walking exercise.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.173#Then, after a general hand-shaking, she asked Henriette:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.174#“You're engaging a new maid, then?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.175#“No,” replied the other, astonished. “Why?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.176#“Because I've just seen a young girl in the ante-room.” Henriette
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.177#interrupted her, laughing. “It's true; all these shop-girls look like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.178#ladies' maids, don't they? Yes, it's a young person come to alter a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.179#mantle.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.180#Mouret looked at her intently, a suspicion crossing his mind. She went
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.181#on with a forced gaiety, explaining that she had bought mantle at The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.182#Ladies' Paradise the previous week.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.183#“What!” asked Madame Marty, “have you deserted Sauveur then?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.184#“No my dear, but I wished to make an experiment. Besides, I was pretty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.185#well satisfied with a first purchase, a travelling cloak. But this time
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.186#it has not succeeded at all. You may say what you like, one is horribly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.187#trussed up in the big shops. I speak out plainly, even before you,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.188#Monsieur Mouret; you will never know how to dress a woman with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.189#slightest claim to distinction.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.190#Mouret did not defend his house, still keeping his eyes on her, thinking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.191#to himself that she would never have dared to do such a thing. And it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.192#was Bouthemont who had to plead the cause of The Ladies' Paradise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.193#“If all the aristocratic ladies who patronise us announced the fact,”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.194# replied he, gaily, “you would be astonished at our customers. Order a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.195#garment to measure at our place, it will equal one from Sauveur's, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.196#will cost but half the money. But there, just because it's cheaper it's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.197#not so good.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.198#“So it doesn't fit, this mantle you speak of?” resumed Madame de
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.199#Boves. “Ah! now I remember the young person. It's rather dark in your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.200#ante-room.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.201#“Yes,” added Madame Marty, “I was wondering where I had seen that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.202#figure. Well, go, my dear, don't stand on ceremony with us.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.203#Henriette assumed a look of disdainful unconcern. “Oh, presently, there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.204#is no hurry.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.205#The ladies continued to discuss the articles from the big shops. Then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.206#Madame de Boves spoke of her husband, who, she said, had gone to inspect
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.207#the breeding depot at Saint-Lô; and just then Henriette was relating
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.208#that through the illness of an aunt Madame Guibal had been suddenly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.209#called into Franche-Comté. Moreover, she did not reckon that day on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.210#Madame Bourdelais, who at the end of every month shut herself up with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.211#a needlewoman to look over her young people's under-linen. But Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.212#Marty seemed agitated with some secret trouble. Her husband's position
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.213#at the Lycée Bonaparte was menaced, in consequence of lessons given by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.214#the poor man in certain doubtful institutions where a regular trade was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.215#carried on with the B.A. diplomas; the poor fellow picked up a pound
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.216#where he could, feverishly, in order to meet the ruinous expenses which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.217#pillaged his household; and his wife, on seeing him weeping one evening
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.218#in the fear of a dismissal, had conceived the idea of getting her friend
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.219#Henriette to speak to a director at the Ministry of Public Instruction
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.220#with whom she was acquainted. Henriette finished by quieting her with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.221#few words. It was understood that Monsieur Marty was coming himself to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.222#know his fate and to thank her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.223#“You look ill, Monsieur Mouret,” observed Madame de Boves.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.224#“Overwork!” repeated De Vallagnosc, with his ironical phlegm.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.225#Mouret quickly got up, as if ashamed at forgetting himself thus. He went
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.226#and took his accustomed place in the midst of the ladies, summoning up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.227#all his agreeable talent. He was now occupied with the winter novelties,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.228#and spoke of a considerable arrival of lace; and Madame de Boves
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.229#questioned him as to the price of Bruges lace: she felt inclined to buy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.230#some. She had now got so far as to economise the thirty-sous for a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.231#cab, often going home quite ill from the effects of stopping before the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.232#windows. Draped in a mantle which was already two years old she tried,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.233#in imagination, on her queenly shoulders all the dearest things she saw;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.234#and it was like tearing her flesh away when she awoke and found herself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.235#dressed in her patched, old dresses, without the slightest hope of ever
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.236#satisfying her passion.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.237#“Baron Hartmann,” announced the man-servant.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.238#Henriette observed with what pleasure Mouret shook hands with the new
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.239#arrival. The latter bowed to the ladies and looked at the young man with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.240#that subtle expression which sometimes illumined his big Alsatian face.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.241#“Always plunged in dress!” murmured he, with a smile. Then, like a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.242#friend of the house, he ventured to add, “There's a charming young girl
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.243#in the ante-room. Who is it?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.244#“Oh, nobody,” replied Madame Desforges, in her ill-natured voice. “Only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.245#a shop-girl waiting to see me.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.246#But the door remained half open, the servant was bringing in the tea.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.247#He went out, came in again, placed the china service on the table,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.248#then some plates of sandwiches and biscuits. In the vast room, a bright
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.249#light, softened by the green plants, illuminated the brass-work, bathing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.250#the silk hangings in a tender flame; and each time the door was opened
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.251#one could perceive an obscure corner of the ante-room, which was only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.252#lighted by two ground-glass windows. There, in the darkness, appeared a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.253#sombre form, motionless and patient. It was Denise, still standing up;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.254#there was a leather-covered form there, but a feeling of pride prevented
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.255#her sitting down on it. She felt the insult keenly. She had been there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.256#for the last half-hour, without a gesture, without a word. The ladies
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.257#and the baron had taken stock of her in passing; she could now hear the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.258#voices from the drawingroom. All this amiable luxury wounded her with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.259#its indifference, and still she did not move. Suddenly, through the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.260#half-open door, she perceived Mouret, and he, on his side, had at last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.261#guessed it to be her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.262#“Is it one of your saleswomen?” asked Baron Hartmann.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.263#Mouret had succeeded in concealing his great agitation; but his voice
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.264#trembled somewhat with emotion: “No doubt; but I don't know which.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.265#“It's the little fair girl from the ready-made department,” replied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.266#Madame Marty, obligingly, “the second-hand, I believe.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.267#Henriette looked at Mouret in her turn.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.268#“Ah!” said he, simply.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.269#And he tried to change the conversation, speaking of the fêtes given to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.270#the King of Prussia then passing through Paris. But the baron returned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.271#maliciously to the young ladies in the big establishments. He affected
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.272#to be desirous of gaining information, and put several questions: Where
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.273#did they come from in general? Was their conduct as bad as it was said
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.274#to be? Quite a discussion ensued.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.275#“Really,” he repeated, “you think them well behaved.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.276#Mouret defended their virtue with a conviction which made De Vallagnosc
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.277#smile. Bouthemont then interfered, to save his chief. Of course there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.278#were some of all sorts, bad and good. Formerly they had nothing but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.279#the refuse of the trade, a poor, vague class of girls drifted into the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.280#drapery business; whilst now, such respectable families as those living
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.281#in the Rue de Sèvres, for instance, positively brought up their girls
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.282#for the Bon Marche. In short, when they liked to conduct themselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.283#well, they could, for they were not, like the work-girls of Paris,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.284#obliged to board and lodge themselves; they had bed and board, their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.285#existence was provided for, an existence excessively hard, no doubt.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.286#The worst of all was their neutral, badly-defined position, between the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.287#shop-woman and the lady. Thrown into the midst of luxury, often without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.288#any previous instruction, they formed a singular, nameless class. Their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.289#misfortunes and vices sprung from that.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.290#“I,” said Madame de Boves, “I don't know any creatures more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.291#disagreeable. Really, one could slap them sometimes.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.292#And the ladies vented their spite. They devoured each other before the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.293#shop-counters; it was a question of woman against woman in the sharp
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.294#rivalry of money and beauty. It was an ill-natured jealousy felt by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.295#saleswomen towards the well-dressed customers, the ladies whose manners
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.296#they tried to imitate, and a still stronger feeling on the part of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.297#poorly-dressed customers, the lower-class ones, against the saleswomen,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.298#those girls dressed in silk, from whom they would have liked to exact a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.299#servant's humility when serving a ten sou purchase.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.300#“Don't speak of them,” said Henriette, by way of conclusion, “a wretched
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.301#lot of beings ready to sell themselves the same as their goods.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.302#[Illustration: 0423]
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.303#Mouret had the strength to smile. The baron was looking at him, so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.304#touched by his graceful command over himself that he changed the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.305#conversation, returning to the fêtes to be given to the King of Prussia,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.306#saying they would be superb, the whole trade of Paris would profit by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.307#them. Henriette remained silent and thoughtful, divided between the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.308#desire to forget Denise in the ante-room, and the fear that Mouret, now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.309#aware of her presence, might go away. At last she quitted her chair.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.310#“You will allow me?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.311#“Certainly, my dear,” replied Madame Marty. “I'll do the honours of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.312#house for you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.313#She got up, took the teapot, and filled the cups. Henriette turned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.314#towards Baron Hartmann, saying: “You'll stay a few minutes, won't you?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.315#“Yes; I want to speak to Monsieur Mouret. We are going to invade your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.316#little drawing-room.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.317#She went out, and her black silk dress, rustling against the door,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.318#produced a noise like that of a snake wriggling through the brushwood.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.319#The baron at once manoeuvred to carry Mouret off, leaving the ladies to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.320#Bouthemont and De Vallagnosc. Then they stood talking before the window
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.321#of the other room in a low tone. It was quite a fresh affair. For a long
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.322#time Mouret had cherished a desire to realise his former project,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.323#the invasion of the whole block by The Ladies' Paradise, from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.324#Rue Monsigny to the Rue de la Michodière and from the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.325#Neuve-Saint-Augustin to the Rue du Dix-Décembre. There was still a vast
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.326#piece of ground, in the latter street, remaining to be acquired, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.327#that sufficed to spoil his triumph, he was tortured with the desire to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.328#complete his conquest, to erect there a sort of apotheosis, a monumental
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.329#façade. As long as his principal entrance should remain in the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.330#Neuve-Saint-Augustin, in a dark street of old Paris, his work would be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.331#incomplete, wanting in logic. He wished to set it up before new Paris,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.332#in one of these modern avenues through which passed the busy crowd
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.333#of the latter part of the nineteenth century. He saw it dominating,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.334#imposing itself as the giant palace of commerce, casting a greater
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.335#shadow over the city than the old Louvre itself. But up to the present
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.336#he had been baulked by the obstinacy of die Credit Immobilier, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.337#still held to its first idea of building a rival to the Grand Hôtel on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.338#this land. The plans were ready, they were only waiting for the clearing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.339#of the Rue du Dix-Décembre to commence the work. At last, by a supreme
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.340#effort, Mouret had almost convinced Baron Hartmann.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.341#“Well!” commenced the latter, “we had a board-meeting yesterday, and I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.342#came to-day, thinking I should meet you, and being desirous of keeping
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.343#you informed. They still resist.” The young man gave way to a nervous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.344#gesture. “But it's ridiculous. What do they say?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.345#“Dear me! they say what I have said to you myself, and what I am still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.346#inclined to think. Your façade is only an ornament, the new buildings
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.347#would only extend by about a tenth the surface of your establishment,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.348#and it would be throwing away immense sums on a mere advertisement.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.349#At this Mouret burst out “An advertisement! an advertisement! In any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.350#case this will be in stone and outlive all of us. Just consider that it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.351#would increase our business tenfold! We should see our money back in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.352#two years. What matters about what you call the wasted ground, if this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.353#ground returns you an enormous interest! You will see the crowd,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.354#when our customers are no longer obliged to struggle through the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.355#Neuve-Saint-Augustin, but can freely pass down a thoroughfare large
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.356#enough for six carriages abreast.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.357#“No doubt,” replied the baron, laughing. “But you are a poet in your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.358#way, let me tell you once more. These gentlemen think it would be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.359#dangerous to further extend your business.' They want to be prudent for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.360#you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.361#“What do they mean? Prudent! I don't understand. Don't the figures show
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.362#the constant progression of our business? At first, with a capital
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.363#of five hundred thousand francs, I did business to the extent of two
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.364#millions, turning the capital over four times. It then became four
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.365#million francs, which, turned over ten times, has produced business to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.366#the extent of forty millions. In short, after successive increases,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.367#I have just learnt, from the last stock-taking, that the amount of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.368#business done now amounts to a total of eighty millions; thus
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.369#the capital, only slightly increased--for it does not exceed six
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.370#millions--has passed over our counters in the form of more than twelve
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.371#times.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.372#He raised his voice, tapping the fingers of his right hand on the palm
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.373#of his left hand, knocking down these millions as he would have cracked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.374#a few nuts. The baron interrupted him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.375#“I know, I know. But you don't hope to keep on increasing in this way,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.376#do you?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.377#“Why not?” asked Mouret, ingenuously. “There's no reason why it should
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.378#stop. The capital can be turned over as often as fifteen times. I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.379#predicted as much long ago. In certain departments it can be turned over
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.380#twenty-five or thirty times. And after? well! after, we'll find a means
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.381#of turning it over more than that.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.382#“So you'll finish by drinking up all the money in Paris, as you'd drink
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.383#a glass of water?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.384#“Most decidedly. Doesn't Paris belong to the women, and don't the women
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.385#belong to us?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.386#The baron laid his hands on Mouret's shoulders, looking at him with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.387#paternal air. “Listen, you're a fine fellow, and I am really fond of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.388#you. There's no resisting you. We'll go into the matter seriously, and I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.389#hope to make them listen to reason. Up to the present, we are perfectly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.390#satisfied with you. Your dividends astonish the Bourse. You must be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.391#right; it will be better to put more money into your business, than to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.392#risk this competition with the Grand Hôtel, which is hazardous.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.393#Mouret's excitement subsided at once; he thanked the baron, but without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.394#any of his usual enthusiasm; and the latter saw him turn his eyes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.395#towards the door of the next room, again seized with the secret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.396#anxiety which he was concealing. However, De Vallagnosc had come up,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.397#understanding that they had finished talking business. He stood close to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.398#them, listening to the baron, who was murmuring with the gallant air of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.399#an old man who had seen life:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.400#“I say, I fancy they're taking their revenge.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.401#“Who?” asked Mouret, embarrassed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.402#“Why, the women. They're getting tired of belonging to you; you now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.403#belong to them, my dear fellow; it's only just!” He joked him, well
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.404#aware of the young man's notorious love affairs: the mansion bought
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.405#for the actress, the enormous sums squandered with girls picked up in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.406#private supper rooms, amused him as an excuse for the follies he had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.407#formerly committed himself. His old experience rejoiced.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.408#“Really, I don't understand,” repeated Mouret.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.409#“Oh! you understand well enough. They always get the last word. In fact,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.410#I said to myself: It isn't possible, he's boasting he can't be so strong
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.411#as that! And there you are! Bleed the women, work them as you would a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.412#coal mine, and what for? In order that they may work you afterwards, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.413#force you to refund at last! Take care, for they'll draw more blood and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.414#money from you than you have ever sucked from them.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.415#He laughed louder still; and De Vallagnosc was also grinning, without,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.416#however, saying a word.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.417#“Dear me! one must have a taste of everything,” confessed Mouret, at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.418#last, pretending to laugh as well. “Money is so stupid, if it isn't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.419#spent.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.420#“As for that, I agree with you,” resumed the baron. “Enjoy yourself, my
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.421#dear fellow, I'll not be the one to preach to you, nor to tremble for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.422#the great interests we have confided to your care. Every one must sow
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.423#his wild oats, and his head is generally clearer afterwards. Besides,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.424#there's nothing unpleasant in ruining one's self when one feels capable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.425#of building up another fortune. But if money is nothing, there are
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.426#certain sufferings----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.427#He stopped, his smile became sad, former sufferings presented themselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.428#amid the irony of his scepticism. He had watched the duel between
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.429#Henriette and Mouret with the curiosity of one who still felt greatly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.430#interested in other people's love battles; and he felt that the crisis
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.431#had arrived, he guessed the drama, well acquainted with the story of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.432#this Denise, whom he had seen in the ante-room.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.433#“Oh! as for suffering, that's not in my line,” said Mouret, in a tone of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.434#bravado. “It's quite enough to pay.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.435#The baron looked at him for a moment without speaking. Without wishing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.436#to insist on his discreet allusion he added, slowly--“Don't make
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.437#yourself worse than you are! You'll lose something else besides your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.438#money at that game. Yes, you'll lose a part of yourself, my dear
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.439#fellow.” He stopped, again laughing, to ask, “That often happens,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.440#doesn't it, Monsieur de Vallagnosc?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.441#“So they say, baron,” the young man simply replied.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.442#Just at this moment the door was opened. Mouret, who was going to reply,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.443#slightly started. The three men turned round. It was Madame Desforges,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.444#looking very gay, putting her head through the doorway to call, in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.445#hurried voice--
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.446#“Monsieur Mouret! Monsieur Mouret!” Then, when she perceived the three
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.447#men, she added, “Oh! you'll excuse me, won't you, gentlemen? I'm going
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.448#to take Monsieur Mouret away for a minute. The least he can do, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.449#he has sold me a frightful mantle, is to give me the benefit of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.450#experience. This girl is a stupid, without the least idea. Come, come!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.451#I'm waiting for you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.452#He hesitated, undecided, flinching before the scene he could foresee.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.453#But he had to obey. The baron said to him, with his air at once paternal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.454#and mocking, “Go, my dear fellow, go, madame wants you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.455#Mouret followed her. The door closed, and he thought he could hear De
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.456#Vallagnosc's grin stifled by the hangings. His courage was entirely
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.457#exhausted. Since Henriette had quitted the drawing-room, and he knew
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.458#Denise was alone in the house in jealous hands, he had experienced a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.459#growing anxiety, a nervous torment, which made him listen from time to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.460#time as if suddenly startled by a distant sound of weeping. What could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.461#this woman invent to torture her? And his whole love, this love which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.462#surprised him even now, went out to the young girl like a support and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.463#a consolation. Never had he loved her so strongly, with that charm so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.464#powerful in suffering. His former affections, his love for Henriette
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.465#herself--so delicate, so handsome, the possession of whom was so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.466#flattering to his pride--had never been more than agreeable pastimes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.467#frequently a calculation, in which he sought nothing but a profitable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.468#pleasure. He used quietly to leave his mistresses and go home to bed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.469#happy in his bachelor liberty, without a regret or a care on his mind;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.470#whilst now his heart beat with anguish, his life was taken, he no longer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.471#enjoyed the forgetfulness of sleep in his great, solitary bed. Denise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.472#was his only thought. Even at this moment she was the sole object of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.473#his anxiety, and he was telling himself that he preferred to be there to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.474#protect her, notwithstanding his fear of some regrettable scene with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.475#other one.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.476#At first, they both crossed the bed-room, silent and empty. Then Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.477#Desforges, pushing open a door, entered the dressing-room, followed by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.478#Mouret. It was a rather large room, hung with red silk, furnished with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.479#a marble toilet table and a large wardrobe with three compartments and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.480#great glass doors. As the window looked into the yard, it was already
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.481#rather dark, and the two nickel-plated gas burners on either side of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.482#wardrobe had been lighted.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.483#“Now, let's see,” said Henriette, “perhaps we shall get on better. This
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.484#girl is a stupid, without the least idea. Come, come! I'm waiting for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.485#you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.486#On entering, Mouret had found Denise standing upright, in the middle of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.487#the bright light. She was very pale, dressed in a cashmere jacket, and a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.488#black hat.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.489#He hesitated, undecided, flinching before the scene he could foresee.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.490#But he had to obey. The baron said to him, with his air at once paternal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.491#and mocking, “Go, my dear fellow, go, madame wants you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.492#Mouret followed her. The door closed, and he thought he could hear De

urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.494#exhausted. Since Henriette had quitted the drawing-room, and he knew
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.495#Denise was alone in the house in jealous hands, he had experienced a

urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.498#this woman invent to torture her? And his whole love, this love which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.499#surprised him even now, went out to the young girl like a support and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.500#a consolation. Never had he loved her so strongly, with that charm so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.501#powerful in suffering. His former affections, his love for Henriette
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.502#herself--so delicate, so handsome, the possession of whom was so

urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.512#other one.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.513#At first, they both crossed the bed-room, silent and empty. Then Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.514#Desforges, pushing open a door, entered the dressing-room, followed by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.515#Mouret. It was a rather large room, hung with red silk, furnished with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.516#a marble toilet table and a large wardrobe with three compartments and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.517#great glass doors. As the window looked into the yard, it was already
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.518#rather dark, and the two nickel-plated gas burners on either side of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.519#wardrobe had been lighted.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.520#“Now, let's see,” said Henriette, “perhaps we shall get on better.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.521#On entering Mouret had found Denise standing upright, in the middle of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.522#a bright light. She was very pale, modestly dressed in a cashmere jacket
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.523#with a black hat, and was holding on one arm the mantle bought at The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.524#Ladies Paradise. When she saw the young man her hands slightly trembled.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.525#“I wish Monsieur Mouret to judge,” resumed Henriette. “Just help me,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.526#mademoiselle.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.527#And Denise, approaching, had to give her the mantle. She had already
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.528#placed some pins on the shoulders, the part that did not fit. Henriette
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.529#turned round to look at herself in the glass.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.530#“Is it possible? Speak frankly.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.531#“It really is a failure, madame,” said Mouret, to cut the matter short.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.532#“It's very simple; the young lady will take your measure, and we will
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.533#make you another.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.534#“No, I want this one, I want it immediately,” resumed she, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.535#vivacity. “But it's too narrow across the chest, and it forms a ruck at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.536#the back between the shoulders.” Then, in her sharpest voice, she added:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.537#“It's no use you standing looking at me, mademoiselle, that won't make
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.538#it any better! Try and find a remedy. It's your business.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.539#Denise again commenced to place the pins, without saying a word. That
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.540#went on for some time: she had to pass from one shoulder to the other,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.541#and was even obliged to go almost on her knees, to pull the mantle down
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.542#in front. Above her placing herself entirely in Denise's hands, Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.543#Desforges gave her face the harsh expression of a mistress exceedingly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.544#difficult to please. Delighted to lower the young girl to this servant's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.545#work, she gave her sharp and brief orders, watching for the least sign
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.546#of suffering on Mouret's face.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.547#“Put a pin here! No! not there, here, near the sleeve. You don't seem
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.548#to understand! That isn't it, there's the ruck showing again. Take care,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.549#you're pricking me now!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.550#Twice had Mouret vainly attempted to interfere, to put an end to this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.551#scene. His heart was beating violently from this humiliation of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.552#love; and he loved Denise more than ever, with a deep tenderness, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.553#the presence of her admirably silent and patient attitude. If the young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.554#girl's hands still trembled somewhat, at being treated in this way
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.555#before his face, she accepted the necessities of her position with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.556#proud resignation of a courageous girl. When Madame Desforges found
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.557#they were not likely to betray themselves, she tried another way, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.558#commenced to smile on Mouret, treating him openly as her lover. The pins
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.559#having run short, she said to him:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.560#“Look, my dear, in the ivory box on the dressing-table. Really! it's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.561#empty? Kindly see on the chimney-piece in the bed-room; you know, at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.562#corner of the looking-glass.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.563#She spoke as if he were quite at home, in the habit of sleeping there,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.564#and knew where to find everything, even the brushes and combs. When he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.565#brought back a few pins, she took them one by one, and forced him to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.566#stay near her, looking at him and speaking low.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.567#“I don't fancy I'm hump-backed. Give me your hand, feel my shoulders,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.568#just to please me. Am I really made like that?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.569#Denise slowly raised her eyes, paler than ever, and set about placing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.570#the pins in silence. Mouret could only see her blonde tresses, twisted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.571#at the back of her delicate neck; but by the slight shudder which was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.572#raising them, he thought he could perceive the uneasiness and shame of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.573#her face. Now, she would certainly repulse him, and send him back to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.574#this woman, who did not conceal her connection even before strangers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.575#Brutal thoughts came into his head, he could have struck Henriette. How
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.576#was he to stop her talk? How should he tell Denise that he adored her,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.577#that she alone existed for him at this moment, and that he was ready to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.578#sacrifice for her all his former affections? The worst of women would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.579#not have indulged in the equivocal familiarities of this well-born lady.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.580#He took his hand away, and drew back, saying:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.581#“You are wrong to go so far, madame, since I myself consider the garment
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.582#to be a failure.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.583#One of the gas-burners was hissing, and in the stuffy, moist air of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.584#room, nothing else was heard but this ardent breath. The looking-glasses
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.585#threw large sheets of light on the red silk hangings, on which were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.586#dancing the shadows of the two women. A bottle of verbena, of which the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.587#cork had been left out, spread a vague odour, something like that of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.588#fading bouquet.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.589#“There, madame, I can do no more,” said Denise, at last, rising up.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.590#She felt thoroughly worn out. Twice she had run the pins in her fingers,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.591#as if blinded, her eyes in a mist. Was he in the plot? Had he sent for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.592#her, to avenge himself for her refusal, by showing that other women
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.593#loved him? And this thought chilled her; she never remembered to have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.594#stood in need of so much courage, not even during the terrible hours of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.595#her life when she wanted for bread. It was comparatively nothing to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.596#humiliated, but to see him almost in the arms of another woman, as if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.597#she had not been there! Henriette looked at herself in the glass, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.598#once more broke out into harsh words.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.599#“But it's absurd, mademoiselle. It fits worse than ever. Just look how
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.600#tight it is across the chest I look like a wet nurse.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.601#Denise, losing all patience, made a rather unfortunate remark. “You are
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.602#slightly stout, madame. We cannot make you thinner than you are.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.603#“Stout! stout!” exclaimed Henriette, who now turned pale in her turn.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.604#“You're becoming insolent, mademoiselle. Really, I should advise you to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.605#criticise others!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.606#They both stood looking at each other, face to face, trembling. There
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.607#was now neither lady or shop-girl. They were simply two women, made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.608#equal by their rivalry. The one had violently taken off the mantle and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.609#cast it on a chair, whilst the other was throwing on the dressing-table
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.610#the few pins she had in her hands.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.611#“What astonishes me,” resumed Henriette, “is that Monsieur Mouret should
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.612#tolerate such insolence. I thought, sir, that you were more particular
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.613#about your employees.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.614#Denise had again assumed her brave, calm manner. She gently replied:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.615#“If Monsieur Mouret keeps me, it's because he has no fault to find. I am
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.616#ready to apologise to you, if he wishes it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.617#Mouret was listening, excited by this quarrel, unable to find a word to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.618#put a stop to it. He had a great horror of these explanations between
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.619#women, their asperity wounding his sense of elegance and gracefulness.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.620#Henriette wished to force him to say something in condemnation of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.621#young girl; and, as he remained mute, still undecided, she stung him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.622#with a final insult:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.623#“Very good, sir. It seems that I must suffer the insolence of your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.624#mistresses in my own house even! A girl you've picked up out of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.625#gutter!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.626#Two big tears gushed from Denise's eyes. She had kept them back for some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.627#time, but her whole being succumbed beneath this last insult. When he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.628#saw her weeping like that, without the slightest attempt at retaliation,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.629#with a silent, despairing dignity, Mouret no longer hesitated, his heart
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.630#went out towards her in an immense burst of tenderness. He took her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.631#hands in his and stammered:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.632#“Go away immediately, my child, and forget this house!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.633#Henriette, perfectly amazed, choking with anger, stood looking at them.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.634#“Wait a minute,” continued he, folding up the mantle himself, “take this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.635#garment away. Madame can buy another elsewhere. And pray don't cry any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.636#more. You know how much I esteem you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.637#He went with her to the door, which he closed after her. She had not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.638#said a word; but a pink flame had coloured her cheeks, whilst her eyes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.639#were wet with fresh tears, tears of a delicious sweetness. Henriette,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.640#who was suffocating, had taken out her handkerchief and was crushing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.641#her lips with it. This was a total overthrowing of her calculations, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.642#herself had been caught in the trap she had laid. She was mortified with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.643#herself for having pushed the matter too far, tortured with jealousy.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.644#To be abandoned for such a creature as that! To see herself disdained
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.645#before her! Her pride suffered more than her love.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.646#“So, it's that girl that you love?” said she, painfully, when they were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.647#alone.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.648#Mouret did not reply at once; he was walking about from the window to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.649#the door, as if absorbed by some violent emotion. At last he stopped,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.650#and very politely, in a voice which he tried to render cold, he replied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.651#with simplicity: “Yes, madame.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.652#The gas burner was still hissing in the stifling air of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.653#dressing-room. But the reflex of the glasses were no longer traversed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.654#by dancing shadows, the room seemed bare, of a heavy dulness. Henriette
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.655#suddenly dropped on a chair, twisting her handkerchief in her febrile
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.656#fingers, repeating amidst her sobs:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.657#“Good heavens! How miserable I am!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.658#He stood looking at her for several seconds, and then went away quietly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.659#She, left all alone, wept on in silence, before the pins scattered over
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.660#the dressing-table and the floor.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.661#When Mouret returned to the little drawing-room, he found De Vallagnosc
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.662#alone, the baron having gone back to the ladies. As he felt himself very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.663#agitated still, he sat down at the further end of the room, on a sofa;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.664#and his friend, seeing him turn pale, charitably came and stood before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.665#him, to conceal him from curious eyes. At first, they looked at each
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.666#other without saying a word. Then De Vallagnosc, who seemed to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.667#inwardly amused at Mouret's confusion, finished by asking in his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.668#bantering voice:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.669#“Are you still enjoying yourself?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.670#Mouret did not appear to understand him at first. But when he remembered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.671#their former conversations on the empty stupidity and the useless
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.672#torture of life, he replied: “Of course, I've never before lived so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.673#much. Ah! my boy, don't you laugh, the hours that make one die of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.674#grief are by far the shortest.” He lowered his voice, continuing gaily,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.675#beneath his half-wiped tears: “Yes, you know all, don't you? Between
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.676#them they have rent my heart. But yet it's nice, as nice as kisses, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.677#wounds they make. I am thoroughly worn out; but, no matter, you can't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.678#think how I love life! Oh! I shall win her at last, this little girl who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.679#still says no!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.680#De Vallagnosc simply said: “And after?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.681#“After? Why, I shall have her! Isn't that enough? If you think yourself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.682#strong, because you refuse to be stupid and to suffer, you make a great
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.683#mistake! You are merely a dupe, my boy, nothing more! Try and long for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.684#a woman and win her at last: that pays you in one minute for all your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.685#misery,” But De Vallagnosc once more trotted out his pessimism. What was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.686#the good of working so much if money could not buy everything? He would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.687#very soon have shut up shop and given up work for ever, the day he found
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.688#out that his millions could not even buy the woman he wanted! Mouret,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.689#listening to him, became grave. Then he set off violently, he believed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.690#in the all-powerfulness of his will.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.691#“I want her, and I'll have her! And if she escapes me, you'll see what
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.692#a place I shall have built to cure myself. It will be splendid, all the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.693#same. You don't understand this language, old man, otherwise you would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.694#know that action contains its own recompense. To act, to create, to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.695#struggle against facts, to overcome them or be overthrown by them, all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.696#human health and joy consists in that!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.697#“Simple method of diverting one's self,” murmured the other.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.698#“Well, I prefer diverting myself. As one must die, I would rather die of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.699#passion than boredom!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.700#They both laughed, this reminded them of their old discussions at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.701#college. De Vallagnosc, in an effeminate voice, then commenced to parade
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.702#his theories of the insipidity of things, investing with a sort of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.703#fanfaronade the immobility and emptiness of his existence. Yes, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.704#dragged on from day to day at the office, in three years he had had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.705#a rise of six hundred francs; he was now receiving three thousand six
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.706#hundred, barely enough to pay for his cigars; it was getting worse than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.707#ever, and if he did not kill himself, it was simply from a dislike of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.708#all trouble. Mouret having spoken of his marriage with Mademoiselle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.709#de Boves, he replied that notwithstanding the obstinacy of the aunt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.710#in refusing to die, the matter was going to be concluded; at least, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.711#thought so, the parents were agreed, and he was ready to do anything
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.712#they might tell him to do. What was the use of wishing or not wishing,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.713#since things never turned out as one desired? He quoted as an example
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.714#his future father-in-law, who expected to find in Madame Guibal an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.715#indolent blonde, the caprice of an hour, but who was now led by her with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.716#a whip, like an old horse on its last legs. Whilst they supposed him to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.717#be busy inspecting the stud at Saint-Lo, she was squandering his last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.718#resources in a little house hired by him at Versailles.'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.719#“He's happier than you,” said Mouret, getting up.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.720#“Oh! rather!” declared De Vallagnosc. “Perhaps it's only doing wrong
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.721#that's somewhat amusing.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.722#Mouret had now recovered his spirits. He was thinking about getting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.723#away; but not wishing his departure to resemble a flight he resolved to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.724#take a cup of tea, and went into the other drawing-room with his friend,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.725#both in high spirits. The baron asked him if the mantle had been made to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.726#fit, and Mouret replied, carelessly, that he gave it up as far as he was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.727#concerned. They all seemed astonished. Whilst Madame Marty hastened to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.728#serve him, Madame de Boves accused the shops of always keeping their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.729#garments too narrow. At last, he managed to sit down near Bouthemont,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.730#who had not stirred. They were forgotten for a moment, and, in reply to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.731#anxious questions put by Bouthemont, desirous of knowing what he had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.732#to say to him, Mouret did not wait to get into the street, but abruptly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.733#informed him that the board of directors had decided to deprive
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.734#themselves of his services. Between each phrase he drank a drop of tea,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.735#protesting all the while that he was in despair. Oh! a quarrel that he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.736#had not even then got over, for he had left the meeting beside himself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.737#with rage. But what could he do? he could not break with these gentlemen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.738#about a simple question of staff. Bouthemont, very pale, had to thank
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.739#him once more.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.740#“What a terrible mantle,” observed Madame Marty. “Henriette can't get
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.741#over it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.742#And really, this prolonged absence began to make every one feel awkward.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.743#But, at that very moment, Madame Desforges appeared.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.744#“So you've given it up as well?” cried Madame de Boves, gaily.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.745#“How do you mean?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.746#“Why, Monsieur Mouret told us you could do nothing with it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.747#Henriette affected the greatest surprise. “Monsieur Mouret was joking.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.748#The mantle will fit splendidly.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.749#They had again returned to the big shops. Mouret had to give his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.750#opinion; he came up to them and affected to be very just The Bon Marche
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.751#was an excellent house, solid, respectable, but the Louvre certainly had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.752#a more aristocratic class of customers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.753#“In short, you prefer The Ladies' Paradise,” said the baron, smiling.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.754#“Yes,” replied Mouret, quietly. “There we really love our customers.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.755#All the women present were of his opinion. It was just that, they were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.756#at a sort of private party at The Ladies' Paradise, they felt, there a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.757#continual caress of flattery, an overflowing adoration which detained
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.758#the most dignified and virtuous woman. The enormous success of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.759#establishment sprung from this gallant seduction.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.760#“By the way,” asked Henriette, who wished to appear entirely at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.761#her ease, “what have you done with my protege. Monsieur Mouret? You
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.762#know--Mademoiselle de Fontenailles.” And turning towards Madame Marty
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.763#she explained, “A maricheness, poor girl, fallen into poverty.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.764#“Oh!” said Mouret, “she earns three francs a day stitching.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.765#De Vallagnosc wished to interfere for a joke. “Don't push him too far,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.766#madame, or he'll tell you that all the old families of France ought to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.767#sell calico.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.768#“Well,” declared Mouret, “it would at least be an honourable end for a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.769#great many of them.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.770#They set up a laugh, the paradox seemed rather strong. He continued to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.771#sing the praises of what he called the aristocracy of work. A slight
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.772#flush had coloured Madame de Boves's cheeks, she was wild at the shifts
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.773#she was put to by her poverty; whilst Madame Marty on the contrary
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.774#approved, stricken with remorse on thinking of her poor husband. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.775#footman had just ushered in the professor, who had called to take her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.776#home. He was drier, more emaciated than ever by his hard labour, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.777#still wore his thin shining frock coat. When he had thanked Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.778#Desforges for having spoken for him at the Ministry, he cast at Mouret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.779#the timid glance of a man meeting the evil that is to kill him. And he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.780#was quite confused when he heard the latter asking him:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.781#“Isn't it true, sir, that work leads to everything?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.782#“Work and economy,” replied he, with a slight shivering of his whole
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.783#body. “Add economy, sir.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.784#Meanwhile, Bouthemont had not moved from his chair, Mouret's words
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.785#were still ringing in his ears. He at last got up, and went and said
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.786#to Henriette in a low tone: “You know, he's given me notice; oh! in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.787#kindest possible manner. But may I be hanged if he sha'n't repent it!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.788#I've just found my sign, The Four Seasons, and shall plant myself close
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.789#to the Opera House!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.790#She looked at him with a gloomy expression. “Reckon on me, I'm with you.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.791#Wait a minute.” And she immediately drew Baron Hartmann into the recess
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.792#of a window, and boldly recommended Bouthemont to him, as a fellow
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.793#who was going to revolutionise Paris, in his turn, by setting up for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.794#himself. When she spoke of an advance of funds for her new protegee, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.795#baron, though now astonished at nothing, could not suppress a gesture of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.796#bewilderment. This was the fourth fellow of genius she had confided to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.797#him, and he began to feel himself ridiculous. But he did not directly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.798#refuse, the idea of starting a competitor to The Ladies' Paradise even
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.799#pleased him somewhat; for he had already invented, in banking matters,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.800#this sort of competition, to keep off others. Besides, the adventure
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.801#amused him, and he promised to look into the matter.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.802#“We must talk it over to-night,” whispered Henriette, returning to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.803#Bouthemont. “Don't fail to call about nine o'clock. The baron is with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.804#us.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.805#At this moment the vast room was foil of voices. Mouret still standing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.806#up, in the midst of the ladies, had recovered his habitual elegant
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.807#gracefulness, and was gaily defending himself from the charge of ruining
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.808#them in dress, offering to prove by the figures that he enabled them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.809#to save thirty per cent on their purchases. Baron Hartmann watched him,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.810#seized with the fraternal admiration of a former man about town. Come!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.811#the duel was finished, Henriette was decidedly beaten, she certainly was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.812#not the coming woman. And he thought he could see the modest profile of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.813#the young girl whom he had observed on passing through the ante-room.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xi.814#She was there, patient, alone, redoubtable in her sweetness.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1#CHAPTER XII.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.2#It was on the 25th of September that the building of the new façade
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.3#of The Ladies' Paradise was commenced. Baron Hartmann, according to his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.4#promise, had had the matter settled at the last general meeting of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.5#the Credit Immobilier. And Mouret was at length going to enjoy the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.6#realisation of his dreams; this façade, about to arise in the Rue du
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.7#Dix-Décembre, was like the very blossoming of his fortune. He wished,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.8#therefore, to celebrate the laying of the first stone, to make a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.9#ceremony of the work, and he distributed gratuities amongst his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.10#employees, and gave them game and champagne for dinner in the evening.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.11#Every one noticed his wonderfully good humour during the ceremony, his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.12#victorious gesture as he laid the first stone, with a flourish of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.13#trowel. For weeks he had been anxious, agitated by a nervous torment
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.14#that he did not always succeed in concealing; and his triumph served
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.15#as a respite, a distraction in his suffering. During the afternoon he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.16#seemed to have returned to his former healthy gaiety. But, after dinner,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.17#when he went through the refectory to drink a glass of champagne with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.18#his staff, he appeared feverish again, smiling with a painful look, his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.19#features drawn up by the unavowed pain that was devouring him. He was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.20#once more mastered by it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.21#The next day, in the ready-made department, Clara tried to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.22#disagreeable with Denise. She had noticed Colomban's bashful passion,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.23#and took it into her head to joke about the Baudus. As Marguerite was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.24#sharpening her pencil while waiting for customers, she said to her, in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.25#loud voice:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.26#“You know my lover opposite. It really grieves me to see him in that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.27#dark shop, where no one ever enters.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.28#“He's not so badly off,” replied Marguerite, “he's going to marry the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.29#governor's daughter.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.30#“Oh! oh!” replied Clara, “it would be good fun to lead him astray, then!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.31#I'll try the game on, my word of honour!” And she continued in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.32#same strain, happy to feel Denise was shocked. The latter forgave her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.33#everything else; but the idea of her dying cousin Geneviève, finished
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.34#by this cruelty, threw her into an indignant rage. At that moment a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.35#customer came in, and as Madame Aurélie had just gone downstairs, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.36#took the direction of the counter, and called Clara.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.37#“Mademoiselle Prunaire, you had better attend to this lady instead of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.38#gossiping there.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.39#“I wasn't gossiping.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.40#“Have the kindness to hold your tongue, and attend to this lady
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.41#immediately.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.42#Clara gave in, conquered. When Denise showed her authority, quietly,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.43#without raising her voice, not one of them resisted. She had acquired
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.44#absolute authority by her very moderation and sweetness. For a moment
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.45#she walked up and down in silence, amidst the young ladies, who had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.46#become very serious. Marguerite had resumed sharpening her pencil, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.47#point of which was always breaking. She alone continued to approve of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.48#Denise's resistance to Mouret, shaking her head, not acknowledging
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.49#the baby she had had, but declaring that if they had any idea of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.50#consequences of such a thing, they would prefer to remain virtuous.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.51#“What! you're getting angry?” said a voice behind Denise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.52#It was Pauline, who was crossing the department. She had noticed the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.53#scene, and spoke in a low tone, smiling.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.54#“But I'm obliged to,” replied Denise in the same tone, “I can't manage
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.55#them otherwise.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.56#Pauline shrugged her shoulders. “Nonsense, you can be queen over all of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.57#us whenever you like.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.58#She was still unable to understand her friend's refusal. Since the end
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.59#of August, Pauline had been married to Baugé, a most stupid affair,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.60#she would sometimes gaily remark. The terrible Bourdoncle treated her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.61#anyhow, now, considering her as lost for trade. Her only terror was that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.62#they might one fine day send them to love each other elsewhere, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.63#the managers had decreed love to be execrable and fatal to business.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.64#So great was her fear, that, when she met Baugé in the galleries,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.65#she affected not to know him. She had just had a fright--old Jouve had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.66#nearly caught her talking to her husband behind a pile of dusters.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.67#“See! he's followed me,” added she, after having hastily related the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.68#adventure to Denise. “Just look at him scenting me out with his big
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.69#nose!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.70#Jouve, in fact, was then coming from the lace department, correctly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.71#arrayed in a white tie, his nose on the scent for some delinquent.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.72#But when he saw Denise he assumed a knowing air, and passed by with an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.73#amiable smile.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.74#“Saved!” murmured Pauline. “My dear, you made him swallow that! I say,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.75#if anything should happen to me, you would speak for me, wouldn't you!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.76#Yes, yes, don't put on that astonished air, we know that a word from you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.77#would revolutionise the house.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.78#And she ran off to her counter. Denise had blushed, troubled by these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.79#amicable allusions. It was true, however. She had a vague sensation of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.80#her power by the flatteries with which she was surrounded. When Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.81#Aurélie returned, and found the department quiet and busy under the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.82#surveillance of the second-hand, she smiled at her amicably. She threw
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.83#over Mouret himself, her amiability increased daily for this young girl
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.84#who might one fine morning desire her situation as first-hand. Denise's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.85#reign was commencing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.86#Bourdoncle alone still stood out. In the secret war which he continued
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.87#to carry on against the young girl, there was in the first place a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.88#natural antipathy, he detested her for her gentleness and her charm.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.89#Then he fought against her as a fatal influence which would place
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.90#the house in peril the day when Mouret should succumb. The governor's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.91#commercial genius seemed bound to sink amidst this stupid affection:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.92#what they had gained by women would be swallowed up by this woman. None
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.93#of them touched his heart, he treated them with the disdain of a man
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.94#without passion, whose trade is to live on them, and who had had his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.95#last illusions dispelled by seeing them too closely in the miseries of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.96#his traffic. Instead of intoxicating him, the odour of these seventy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.97#thousand customers gave him frightful headaches: and so soon as he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.98#reached home he beat his mistresses. And what made him especially
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.99#anxious in the presence of this little saleswoman, who had gradually
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.100#become so redoubtable, was that he did not in the least believe in her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.101#disinterestedness, in the genuineness of her refusals. For him she was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.102#playing a part, the most skilful of parts; for if she had yielded at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.103#once, Mouret would doubtless have forgotten her the next day; whilst by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.104#refusing, she had goaded his desires, rendering him mad, capable of any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.105#folly. An artful jade, a woman learned in vice, would not have acted any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.106#different to this pattern of innocence.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.107#Thus Bourdoncle could never catch sight of her, with her clear eyes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.108#sweet face, and simple attitude, without being seized with a real fear,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.109#as if he had before him some disguised female flesh-eater, the sombre
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.110#enigma of woman, Death in the guise of a virgin. In what way could he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.111#confound the tactics of this false novice? He was now only anxious to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.112#penetrate her artful ways, in the hope of exposing them to the light of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.113#day. She would certainly commit some fault, he would surprise her with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.114#one of her lovers, and she should again be dismissed. The house would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.115#then resume its regular working like a well wound-up machine.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.116#“Keep a good look-out, Monsieur Jouve,” repeated Bourdoncle to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.117#inspector. “I'll take care that you shall be rewarded.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.118#But Jouve was somewhat lukewarm, he knew something about women, and was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.119#asking himself whether he had not better take the part of this young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.120#girl, who might be the future sovereign mistress of the place. Though he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.121#did not now dare to touch her, he still thought her bewitchingly pretty.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.122#His colonel in bygone days had killed himself for a similar little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.123#thing, with an insignificant face, delicate and modest, one look from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.124#whom ravaged all hearts.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.125#“I do,” replied he. “But, on my word, I cannot discover anything.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.126#And yet stories were circulating, there was quite a stream of abominable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.127#tittle-tattle running beneath the flattery and respect Denise felt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.128#arising around her. The whole house now declared that she had formerly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.129#had Hutin for a lover; no one could swear that the intimacy still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.130#continued, but they were suspected of meeting from time to time. Deloche
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.131#also was said to sleep with her, they were continually meeting in dark
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.132#corners, talking for hours together. It was quite a scandal!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.133#“So, nothing about the first-hand in the silk department, nor about the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.134#young man in the lace one?” asked Bourdoncle.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.135#“No, sir, nothing yet,” replied the inspector.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.136#It was with Deloche especially that Bourdoncle expected to surprise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.137#Denise. One morning he himself had caught them laughing together
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.138#downstairs. In the meantime, he treated her on a footing of perfect
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.139#equality, for he no longer disdained her, he felt her to be strong
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.140#enough to overthrow even him, notwithstanding his ten years' service, if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.141#he lost the game.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.142#“Keep your eye on the young man in the lace department,” concluded he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.143#each time. “They are always together. If you catch them, call me, I'll
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.144#manage the rest.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.145#Mouret, however, was living in anguish. Was it possible that this child
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.146#could torture him in this manner? He could always recall her arriving at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.147#The Ladies' Paradise, with her big shoes, thin black dress, and savage
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.148#airs. She stammered, they all used to laugh at her, he himself had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.149#thought her ugly at first. Ugly! and now she could have brought him on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.150#his knees by a look, he thought her nothing less than an angel! Then she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.151#had remained the last in the house, repulsed, joked at, treated by him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.152#as a curious specimen of humanity. For months he had wanted to see how
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.153#a girl sprung up, and had amused himself at this experiment, without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.154#understanding that he was risking his heart. She, little by little grew
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.155#up, became redoubtable. Perhaps he had loved her from the first moment,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.156#even at the time he thought he felt nothing but pity for her. And yet he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.157#had only really begun to feel this love the evening of their walk under
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.158#the chestnut trees of the Tuileries. His life started from there, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.159#could still hear the laughing of a group of little girls, the distant
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.160#fall of a jet of water, whilst in the warm shade she walked on beside
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.161#him in silence. After that he knew no more, his fever had increased hour
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.162#by hour; all his blood, his whole being, in fact, was sacrificed. And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.163#for such a child--was it possible? When she passed him now, the slight
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.164#wind from her dress seemed so powerful that he staggered.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.165#For a long time he had struggled, and even now he frequently became
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.166#indignant, endeavouring to extricate himself from this idiotic
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.167#possession. What secret had she to be able to bind him in this way? Had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.168#he not seen her without boots? Had she not been received almost out of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.169#charity? He could have understood it had it been a question of one of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.170#those superb creatures who charm the crowd, but this little girl; this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.171#nobody! She had, in short, one of those insignificant faces which excite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.172#no remark. She could not even be very intelligent, for he remembered her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.173#bad beginning as a saleswoman. But, after every explosion of anger, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.174#had experienced a relapse of passion, like a sacred terror at having
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.175#insulted his idol. She possessed everything that renders a woman
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.176#good--courage, gaiety, simplicity; and there exhaled from her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.177#gentleness, a charm of a penetrating, perfume-like subtlety. One might
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.178#at first ignore her, or elbow her like any other girl; but the charm
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.179#soon began to act, with a slow invincible force; one belonged to her for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.180#ever, if she deigned to smile. Everything then smiled in her white face,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.181#her pretty eyes, her cheeks and chin full of dimples; whilst her heavy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.182#blonde hair seemed to light up also, with a royal and conquering beauty.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.183#He acknowledged himself vanquished; she was as intelligent as she was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.184#beautiful, her intelligence came from the best part of her being. Whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.185#the other saleswomen had only a superficial education, the varnish which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.186#scales off from girls of that class, she, without any false elegance,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.187#retained her native grace, the savour of her origin. The most complete
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.188#commercial ideas sprang up from her experience, under this narrow
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.189#forehead, the pure lines of which clearly announced the presence of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.190#firm will and a love of order. And he could have clasped his hands to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.191#ask her pardon for having blasphemed her during his hours of revolt.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.192#Why did she still refuse with such obstinacy. Twenty times had he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.193#entreated her, increasing his offers, offering money and more money.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.194#Then, thinking she must be ambitious, he had promised to appoint her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.195#first-hand, as soon as there should be a vacant department And she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.196#refused, and still she refused Î For him it was a stupor, a struggle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.197#in which his desire became enraged. Such an adventure appeared to him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.198#impossible, this child would certainly finish by yielding, for he had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.199#always regarded a woman's virtue as a relative matter. He could see no
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.200#other object, everything disappeared before this necessity: to have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.201#her at last in his room, to take her on his knees, and, kiss her on her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.202#lips; and at this vision, the blood of his veins ran quick and strong,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.203#he trembled, distracted by his own powerlessness.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.204#His days now passed in the same grievous obsession, Denise's image rose
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.205#with him; after having dreamed of her all night, it followed him before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.206#the desk in his office, where he signed his bills and orders from nine
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.207#to ten o'clock: a work which he accomplished mechanically, never ceasing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.208#to feel her present, still saying no, with her quiet air. Then, at ten
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.209#o'clock, came the board-meeting, a meeting of the twelve directors, at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.210#which he had to preside; they discussed matters affecting the in-door
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.211#arrangements, examined the purchases, settled the window displays; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.212#she was still there, he heard her soft voice amidst the figures, he saw
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.213#her bright smile in the most complicated financial situations. After
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.214#the board-meeting, she still accompanied him, making with him the daily
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.215#inspection of the counters, returned with him to his office in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.216#afternoon, remaining close to his chair from two till four o'clock,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.217#whilst he received a crowd of important business men, the principal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.218#manufacturers of all France, bankers, inventors; a continual come-and-go
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.219#of the riches and intelligence of the land, an excited dance of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.220#millions, rapid interviews during which were hatched the biggest affairs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.221#on the Paris market. If he forgot her for a moment whilst deciding
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.222#on the ruin or the prosperity of an industry, he found her again at a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.223#twitch of his heart; his voice died away, he asked himself what was the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.224#use of this princely fortune when she still refused. At last, when five
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.225#o'clock struck, he had to sign the day's correspondence, the mechanical
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.226#working of his hand again commenced, whilst she rose up before him more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.227#dominating than ever, seizing him entirely, to possess him during the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.228#solitary and ardent hours of the night. And the morrow was the same day
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.229#over again, those days so active, so full of a colossal labour, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.230#the slight shadow of a child sufficed to ravage with anguish.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.231#But it was especially during his daily inspection of the departments
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.232#that he felt his misery. To have built up this giant machine, to reign
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.233#over such a world of people, and to be dying of grief because a little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.234#girl would not accept him! He scorned himself, dragging the fever and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.235#shame of his pain about with him everywhere. On certain days he became
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.236#disgusted with his power, feeling a nausea at the very sight of the long
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.237#galleries. At other times he would have wished to extend his empire, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.238#make it so vast that she would perhaps yield out of sheer admiration and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.239#fear.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.240#He first of all stopped in the basement opposite the shoot. It was still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.241#in the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin; but it had been necessary to enlarge
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.242#it, and it was now as wide as the bed of a river, down which the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.243#continual flood of goods rolled with the loud noise of rushing water; it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.244#was a constant succession of arrivals from all parts of the world, rows
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.245#of waggons from all railways, a ceaseless discharging of merchandise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.246#a stream of boxes and bales running underground, absorbed by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.247#insatiable establishment. He gazed at this torrent flowing into his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.248#house, thought of his position as one of the masters of the public
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.249#fortune, that he held in his hands the fate of the French manufacturers,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.250#and that he was unable to buy a kiss from one of his saleswomen.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.251#Then he passed on to the receiving department, which now occupied that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.252#part of the basement running along the Rue Monsigny. Twenty tables were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.253#ranged there, in the pale light of the air-holes; dozens of shopmen were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.254#bustling about, emptying the cases, checking the goods, and marking them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.255#in plain figures, amidst the roar of the shoot, which almost drowned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.256#their voices. Various managers of departments stopped him, he had to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.257#resolve difficulties and confirm orders. This cellar was filled with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.258#tender glimmer of the satin, the whiteness of the linen, a prodigious
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.259#unpacking in which the furs were mingled with the lace, the fancy goods
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.260#with the Eastern curtains. With a slow step he made his way amongst all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.261#these riches thrown about in disorder, heaped up in their rough state.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.262#Above, they were destined to ornament the window displays, letting loose
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.263#the race after money across the counters, no sooner shown than carried
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.264#off, in the furious current of business which traversed the place. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.265#thought of his having offered the young girl silks, velvets, anything
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.266#she liked to take in any quantities, from these enormous heaps, and that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.267#she had refused by a shake of her fair head.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.268#After that, he passed on to the other end of the basement, to pay his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.269#usual visit to the delivery department. Interminable corridors ran
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.270#along, lighted up with gas; to the right and to the left, the reserves,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.271#closed in with gratings, were like so many subterranean stores, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.272#complete commercial quarter, with its haberdashery, underclothing,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.273#glove, and other shops, sleeping in the shade. Further on was placed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.274#one of the three stoves; further still, a fireman's post guarding
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.275#the gas-meter, enclosed in its iron cage. He found, in the delivery
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.276#department, the sorting tables already blocked with loads of parcels,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.277#bandboxes, and cases, continually arriving in large baskets; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.278#Campion, the superintendent, gave him some particulars about the current
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.279#work, whilst the twenty men placed under his orders distributed the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.280#parcels into large compartments, each bearing the name of a district of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.281#Paris, and from whence the messengers took them up to the vans, ranged
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.282#along the pavement. One heard a series of cries, names of streets, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.283#recommendations shouted out; quite an uproar, an agitation such as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.284#on board a mail boat about to start. And he stood there for a moment,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.285#motionless, looking at this discharge of goods which he had just seen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.286#absorbed by the house, at the opposite extremity of the basement: the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.287#enormous current there discharged itself into the street, after having
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.288#filled the tills with gold. His eyes became misty, this colossal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.289#business no longer had any importance; he had but one idea, that of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.290#going away to some distant, land, and abandoning everything, if she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.291#persisted in saying no.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.292#He then went upstairs, continuing his inspection, talking, and agitating
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.293#himself more and more, without finding any respite. On the second floor
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.294#he entered the correspondence department, picking quarrels, secretly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.295#exasperated against the perfect regularity of this machine that he had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.296#himself built up. This department was the one that was daily assuming
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.297#the most considerable importance; it now required two hundred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.298#employees--some opening, reading, and classifying the letters coming
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.299#from the provinces and abroad, whilst others gathered into compartments
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.300#the goods ordered by the correspondents. And the number of letters was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.301#increasing to such an extent that they no longer counted them; they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.302#weighed them, receiving as much as a hundred pounds per day. He,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.303#feverish, went through the three offices, questioning Levasseur as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.304#to the weight of the correspondence; eighty pounds, ninety pounds,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.305#sometimes, on a Monday, a hundred pounds. The figure increased daily, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.306#ought to have been delighted. But he stood shuddering, in the noise made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.307#by the neighbouring squad of packers nailing down the cases. Vainly he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.308#roamed about the house; the fixed idea remained fast in his mind, and as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.309#his power unfolded itself before him, as the mechanism of the business
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.310#and the army of employees passed before his gaze, he felt more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.311#profoundly than ever the insult of his powerlessness. Orders from all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.312#Europe were flowing in, a special post-office van was required for his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.313#correspondence; and yet she said no, always no.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.314#He went downstairs again, visiting the central cashier's office, where
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.315#four clerks guarded the two giants safes, in which there had passed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.316#the previous year forty-eight million francs. He glanced at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.317#clearing-house, which now occupied twenty-five clerks, chosen from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.318#amongst the most trustworthy. He went into the next office, where
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.319#twenty-five young men, junior clerks, were engaged in checking the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.320#debit-notes, and calculating the salesmen's commission. He returned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.321#to the chief cashier's office, exasperated at the sight of the safes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.322#wandering amidst these millions, the uselessness of which drove him mad.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.323#She said no, always no.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.324#And it was always no, in all the departments, in the galleries, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.325#saloons, and in every part of the establishment! He went from the silk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.326#to the drapery department, from the linen to the lace department, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.327#ascended to the upper floors, stopping on the flying bridges, prolonging
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.328#his inspection with a maniacal, grievous minuteness. The house had grown
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.329#out of all bounds, he had created this department, then this other; he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.330#governed this fresh domain, he extended his empire into this industry,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.331#the last one conquered; and it was no, always no, in spite of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.332#everything. His staff would now have sufficed to people a small town:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.333#there were fifteen hundred salesmen, and a thousand other employees
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.334#of every sort, including forty inspectors and seventy cashiers; the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.335#kitchens alone gave occupation to thirty-two men; ten clerks were set
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.336#apart for the advertising; there were three hundred and fifty shop
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.337#messengers, all wearing livery, and twenty-four firemen living on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.338#premises. And, in the stables, royal buildings situated in the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.339#Monsigny, opposite the warehouse, were one hundred and forty-five
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.340#horses, a luxurious establishment which was already celebrated in Paris.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.341#The first four conveyances which used formerly to stir up the whole
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.342#neighbourhood, when the house occupied only the corner of the Place
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.343#Gaillon, had gradually increased to sixty-two trucks, one-horse vans,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.344#and heavy two-horse ones. They were continually scouring Paris, driven
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.345#with knowing skill by drivers dressed in black, promenading the gold
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.346#and purple sign of The Ladies' Paradise. They even went beyond the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.347#fortifications, into the suburbs; they were to be met on the dusty roads
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.348#of Bicêtre, along the banks of the Marne, even in the shady drives of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.349#the Forest of Saint-Germain. Sometimes one would spring up from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.350#depths of some sunny avenue, where all was silent and deserted, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.351#superb animals trotting along, throwing into the mysterious peacefulness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.352#of this grand nature the loud advertisement of its varnished panels. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.353#was even dreaming of launching them further still, into the neighbouring
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.354#departments; he would have liked to hear them rolling along every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.355#road in France, from one frontier to the other. But he no longer even
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.356#troubled to visit his horses, though he was passionately fond of them.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.357#Of what good was this conquest of the world, since it was no, always no?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.358#At present, in the evening, when he arrived at Lhomme's desk, he still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.359#looked through habit at the amount of the takings written on a card,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.360#which the cashier stuck on an iron file at his side; this figure rarely
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.361#fell below a hundred thousand francs, sometimes it ran up to eight and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.362#nine hundred thousand, on big sale days; but these figures no longer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.363#sounded in his ears like a trumpet-blast, he regretted having looked at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.364#them, going away full of bitterness and scorn for money.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.365#But Mouret's sufferings were destined to increase, for he became
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.366#jealous. One morning, in the office, before the boardmeeting commenced,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.367#Bourdoncle ventured to hint that the little girl in the ready-made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.368#department was playing with him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.369#“How?” asked he, very pale.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.370#“Yes! she has lovers in this very building.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.371#Mouret found strength to smile. “I don't think any more about her, my
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.372#dear fellow. You can speak freely. Who are her lovers?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.373#“Hutin, they say, and then a salesman in the lace department--Deloche,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.374#that tall awkward fellow. I can't speak with certainty, never having
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.375#seen them together. But it appears that it's notorious.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.376#There was a silence. Mouret affected to arrange the papers on his desk,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.377#to conceal the trembling of his hands. At last, he observed, without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.378#raising his head: “We must have proofs, try and bring me some proofs. As
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.379#for me, I assure you I don't, care in the least, for I'm quite sick of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.380#her. But we can't allow such things to go on here.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.381#Bourdoncle simply replied: “Never fear, you shall have proofs one of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.382#these days. I'm keeping a good look out.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.383#This news deprived Mouret of all rest. He no longer had the courage to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.384#return to this conversation, but lived in the continual expectation of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.385#a catastrophe, in which his heart would be crushed. And this torment
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.386#rendered him terrible, the whole house trembled before him. He now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.387#disdained to conceal himself behind Bourdoncle, but performed the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.388#executions in person, feeling a nervous desire for revenge, solacing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.389#himself by an abuse of his power, of that power which could do nothing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.390#for the contentment of his sole desire. Each one of his inspections
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.391#became a massacre, his appearance caused a panic to run along from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.392#counter to counter. The dead winter season was just then approaching,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.393#and he made a clean sweep in the departments, multiplying the victims
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.394#and pushing them into the streets. His first idea had been to dismiss
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.395#Hutin and Deloche; then he had reflected that if he did not keep them,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.396#he would never discover anything; and the others suffered for them: the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.397#whole staff trembled. In the evening, when he found himself alone again,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.398#his eyes swelled up, big with tears.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.399#One day especially terror reigned supreme. An inspector had the idea
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.400#that Mignot was stealing. There were always a lot of strange-looking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.401#girls prowling around his counter; and one of them had just been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.402#arrested, her thighs and bosom padded with sixty pairs of gloves. From
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.403#that moment a watch was kept, and the inspector caught Mignot in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.404#act, facilitating the sleight of hand of a tall fair girl, formerly a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.405#saleswoman at the Louvre, but since gone wrong: the manouvre was very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.406#simple, he affected to try some gloves on her, waited till she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.407#padded herself, and then conducted her to the pay-desk, where she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.408#paid for a single pair only. Mouret happened to be there, just at that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.409#moment. As a rule, he preferred not to mix himself up with these sort of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.410#adventures, which were pretty frequent; for notwithstanding the regular
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.411#working of the well-arranged machine, great disorder reigned in certain
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.412#departments of The Ladies' Paradise, and scarcely a week passed without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.413#some employee being dismissed for theft. The authorities preferred to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.414#hush up such matters as far as possible, considering it useless to set
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.415#the police at work, and thus expose one of the fatal plague-spots of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.416#these great bazaars. But, that day, Mouret felt a real need of getting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.417#angry with some one, and he treated the handsome Mignot with such
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.418#violence, and the latter stood there trembling with fear, his face pale
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.419#and discomposed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.420#“I ought to call a policeman,” cried Mouret, before all the other
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.421#salesmen. “But why don't you answer? who is this woman? I swear I'll
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.422#send for the police, if you don't tell me the truth.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.423#They had taken the woman away, and two saleswomen were undressing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.424#her. Mignot stammered out: “I don't know her, sir. She's the one who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.425#came----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.426#“Don't tell lies!” interrupted Mouret, in a violent rage. “And there's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.427#nobody here to warn us! You are all in the plot, on my word! We are in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.428#a regular wood, robbed, pillaged, plundered. It's enough to make us have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.429#the pockets of each one searched before going out!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.430#Murmurs were heard. The three or four customers buying gloves stood
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.431#looking on, frightened.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.432#“Silence!” resumed he, furiously, “or I'll clear the place!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.433#But Bourdoncle came running up, anxious at the idea of the scandal.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.434#He whispered a few words in Mouret's ear, the affair was assuming an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.435#exceptional gravity; and he prevailed on him to take Mignot into the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.436#inspectors' office, a room on the ground floor near the entrance in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.437#Rue Gaillon. The woman was there, quietly putting on her stays again.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.438#She had just mentioned Albert Lhomme's name. Mignot, again questioned,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.439#lost his head, and commenced to sob; he wasn't in fault, it was Albert
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.440#who sent him his mistresses; at first he had merely afforded them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.441#certain advantages, enabling them to profit by the bargains; then, when
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.442#they at last took to stealing, he was already too far compromised
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.443#to report the matter. The principals now discovered a series of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.444#extraordinary robberies; goods taken away by girls, who went into the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.445#neighbouring W.Cs, built near the refreshment bar and surrounded by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.446#evergreen plants, to hide the goods under their petticoats; purchases
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.447#that a salesman neglected to call out at a pay-desk, when he accompanied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.448#a customer there, the price of which he divided with the cashier; even
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.449#down to false returns, articles which they announced as brought back to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.450#the house, pocketing the money thus repaid; without even mentioning the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.451#classical robbery, parcels taken out under their coats in the evening,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.452#rolled round their bodies, and sometimes even hung down their leg's. For
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.453#the last fourteen months, thanks to Mignot and other salesmen, no doubt,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.454#whom they refused to name, this pilfering had been going on at Albert's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.455#desk, quite an impudent trade, for sums of which no one ever knew the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.456#exact total.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.457#Meanwhile the news had spread into the various departments, causing the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.458#guilty consciences to tremble, and the most honest ones to quake at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.459#the general sweep that seemed imminent. Albert had disappeared into the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.460#inspectors' office. Next his father had passed, choking, his face full
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.461#of blood, showing signs of apoplexy. Madame Aurélie herself was then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.462#called; and she, her head high beneath the affront, had the fat,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.463#puffed-up appearance of a wax mask. The explanation lasted some time,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.464#no one knew the exact details; but it was said the firsthand had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.465#slapped her son's face, and that the worthy old father wept, whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.466#the governor, contrary to all his elegant habits, swore like a trooper,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.467#absolutely wanting to deliver the offenders up to justice. However, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.468#scandal was hushed up. Mignot was the only one dismissed there and then.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.469#Albert did not disappear till two days later; no doubt his mother
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.470#had begged that the family should not be dishonoured by an immediate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.471#execution. But the panic lasted several days longer, for after this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.472#scene Mouret had wandered from one end of the establishment to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.473#other, with a terrible expression, venting his anger on all those who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.474#dared even to raise their eyes.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.475#“What are you doing there, sir, looking at the flies? Go and be paid!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.476#At last, the storm burst one day on the head of Hutin himself. Favier,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.477#appointed second-hand, was undermining the first-hand, in order to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.478#dislodge him from his position. This was always the way; he addressed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.479#crafty reports to the directors, taking advantage of every occasion to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.480#have the first-hand caught doing something wrong. Thus, one morning, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.481#Mouret was going through the silk department, he stopped, surprised to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.482#see Favier engaged in altering the price tickets of a stock of black
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.483#velvet.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.484#“Why are you lowering the prices?” asked he. “Who gave you the order to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.485#do so?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.486#The second-hand, who was making a great noise over this work, as if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.487#he wished to attract the governor's attention, foreseeing the result,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.488#replied with an innocent, surprised air:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.489#“Why, Monsieur Hutin told me, sir.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.490#“Monsieur Hutin! Where is Monsieur Hutin?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.491#And when the latter came upstairs, called by a salesman, an animated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.492#explanation ensued. What! he undertook to lower the prices himself now!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.493#But he appeared greatly astonished in his turn, having merely talked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.494#over the matter with Favier, without giving any positive orders. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.495#latter then assumed the sorrowful air of an employee who finds himself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.496#obliged to contradict his superior. However, he was quite willing to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.497#accept the blame, if it would get the latter out of a scrape. Things
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.498#began to look very bad.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.499#“Understand, Monsieur Hutin!” cried Mouret, “I have never tolerated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.500#these attempts at independence. We alone decide about the prices.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.501#He continued, with a sharp voice, and wounding intentions, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.502#surprised the salesmen, for as a rule these discussions were carried
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.503#on quietly, and the case might really have resulted from a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.504#misunderstanding. One could feel he had some unavowed spite to satisfy.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.505#He had at last caught that Hutin at fault, that Hutin who was said to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.506#Denise's lover! He could now solace himself, by making him feel that he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.507#was the master! And he exaggerated matters, even insinuating that this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.508#reduction of price appeared to conceal very questionable intentions.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.509#“Sir,” repeated Hutin, “I meant to consult you about it. It is really
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.510#necessary, as you know, for these velvets have not succeeded.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.511#Mouret cut him short with a final insult. “Very good, sir; we will look
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.512#into the matter. But don't do such a thing again, if you value your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.513#place.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.514#And he walked off. Hutin, bewildered, furious, finding no one but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.515#Favier to confide in, swore he would go and throw his resignation at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.516#brute's head. But he soon left off talking of going away, and began to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.517#stir up all the abominable accusations which were current amongst the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.518#salesmen against their chiefs. And Favier, his eye sparkling, defended
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.519#himself with a great show of sympathy. He was obliged to reply, wasn't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.520#he? Besides, could any one have foreseen such a row for so trifling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.521#a matter? What had come to the governor lately, that he should be so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.522#unbearable?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.523#“We all know what's the matter with him,” replied Hutin, “Is it my fault
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.524#if that little jade in the dress-department is turning his head? My dear
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.525#fellow, you can see the blow comes from there. He's aware I've slept
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.526#with her, and he doesn't like it; or perhaps it's she herself who wants
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.527#to get me pitched out, because I'm in her way. But I swear she shall
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.528#hear from me, if ever she crosses my path.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.529#Two days after, as Hutin was going up into the work-room, upstairs,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.530#under the roof, to recommend a person, he started on perceiving at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.531#end of a passage Denise and Deloche leaning out of a window, and plunged
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.532#so deeply in private conversation that they did not even turn round. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.533#idea of having them caught occurred to him suddenly, when he perceived
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.534#with astonishment that Deloche was weeping. He at once went away without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.535#making any noise; and meeting Bourdoncle and Jouve on the stairs, told
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.536#them some story about one of the _extincteurs_ the door of which seemed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.537#to be broken; in this way they would go upstairs and drop on to the two
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.538#others. Bourdoncle discovered them first. He stopped short, and told
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.539#Jouve to go and fetch the governor, whilst he remained there. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.540#inspector had to obey, greatly annoyed at being forced to compromise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.541#himself in such a matter.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.542#This was a lost corner of the vast world in which the people of The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.543#Ladies' Paradise worked. One arrived there by a complication of stairs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.544#and passages. The work-rooms occupied the top of the house, a succession
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.545#of low sloping rooms, lighted by large windows cut in the zinc roof,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.546#furnished solely with long tables and enormous iron stoves; and right
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.547#along were a crowd of work-girls of all sorts, for the under-clothing,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.548#the lace, the dressmaking, and the house furnishing; living winter and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.549#summer in a stifling heat, amidst the odour special to the business;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.550#and one had to go straight through the wing, and turn to the right
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.551#on passing the dressmakers, before coming to this solitary end of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.552#corridor. The rare customers, that a salesman occasionally brought
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.553#here for an order, gasped for breath, tired out, frightened, with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.554#sensation of having been turning round for hours and hours, and of being
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.555#a hundred leagues above the street.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.556#Denise had often found Deloche waiting for her. As secondhand she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.557#charge of the arrangements between her department and the work-room
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.558#where only the models and alterations were done, and was always going up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.559#and down to give the necessary orders. He watched for her, inventing any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.560#pretext to run after her; then he affected to be surprised when he met
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.561#her at the work-room door. She got to laugh about the matter, it became
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.562#quite an understood thing. The corridor ran alongside the cistern, an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.563#enormous iron tank containing twelve thousand gallons of water; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.564#there was another one of equal size on the roof, reached by an iron
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.565#ladder. For an instant, Deloche would stand talking, leaning with one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.566#shoulder against the cistern in the continual abandonment of his long
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.567#body, bent with fatigue. The noise of the water was heard, a mysterious
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.568#noise of which the iron tank ever retained the musical vibration.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.569#Notwithstanding the deep silence, Denise would turn round anxiously,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.570#thinking she had seen a shadow pass on the bare, yellow-painted walls.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.571#But the window would soon attract them, they would lean out, and forget
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.572#themselves in a pleasant gossip, in endless souvenirs of their native
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.573#place. Below them, extended the immense glass roof of the central
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.574#gallery, a lake of glass bounded by the distant housetops, like a rocky
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.575#coast. Beyond, they saw nothing but the sky, a sheet of sky, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.576#reflected in the sleeping water of the glazed work the flight of its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.577#clouds and the tender blue of its azure.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.578#It so happened that Deloche was speaking of Valognes that day. “I was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.579#six years old; my mother took me to Valognes market in a cart. You know
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.580#it's ten miles away; we had to leave Bricquebec at five o'clock. It's a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.581#fine country down our way. Do you know it?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.582#“Yes, yes,” replied Denise, slowly, her looks lost in the distance. “I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.583#was there once, but was very little then. Nice roads with grass on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.584#each side, aren't there? and now and again sheep browsing in couples,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.585#dragging their clog along by the rope.” She stopped, then resumed with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.586#a vague smile: “Our roads run as straight as an arrow for miles between
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.587#rows of trees which afford a lot of shade. We have meadows surrounded
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.588#with hedges taller than I am, where there are horses and cows feeding.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.589#We have a little river, and the water is very cold, under the brushwood,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.590#in a spot I know well.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.591#“It is the same with us, exactly!” cried Deloche, delighted. “There's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.592#grass everywhere, each one encloses his plot with thorns and elms, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.593#is at once at home; and it's quite green, a green far different to what
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.594#we see in Paris. Dear me! what fun I've had at the bottom of the road,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.595#to the left, coming down from the mill!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.596#And their voices died away, they stopped with their eyes fixed and lost
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.597#on the sunny lake of the glazed work. A mirage rose up before them from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.598#this blinding water, they saw an endless succession of meadows, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.599#Cotentin bathed in the balmy breath of the ocean, a luminous vapour,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.600#which melted the horizon into a delicate pearly grey. Below, under the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.601#colossal iron framework, in the silk hall, roared the business, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.602#trepidation of the machine at work; the entire house vibrated with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.603#trampling of the crowd, the bustle of the shopmen, and the life of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.604#thirty thousand persons elbowing each other there; and they, carried
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.605#away by their dreams, on feeling this profound and dull clamour with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.606#which the roofs were resounding, thought they heard the wind passing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.607#over the grass, shaking the tall trees.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.608#“Ah! Mademoiselle Denise,” stammered Deloche, “why aren't you kinder to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.609#me? I love you so much!” Tears had come into his eyes, and as she tried
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.610#to interrupt him with a gesture, he continued quickly: “No--let me tell
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.611#you these things once more. We should get on so well together! People
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.612#always find something to talk about when they come from the same place.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.613#He was choking, and she at last managed to say kindly: “You're
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.614#not reasonable; you promised me never to speak of that again. It's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.615#impossible. I have a good friendship for you, because you're a nice
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.616#fellow; but I wish to remain free.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.617#“Yes, yes. I know it,” replied he in a broken voice, “you don't love me.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.618#Oh! you may say so, I quite understand it. There's nothing in me to make
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.619#you love me. Listen, I've only had one sweet moment in my life, and that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.620#was when I met you at Joinville, do you remember? For a moment under the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.621#trees, when it was so dark, I thought your arm trembled, and was stupid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.622#enough to imagine----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.623#But she again interrupted him. Her quick ear had just caught
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.624#Bourdoncle's and Jouve's steps at the end of the corridor.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.625#“Hark, there's some one coming.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.626#“No,” said he, preventing her leaving the window, “it's in the cistern:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.627#all sorts of extraordinary noises come up from it, as if there were some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.628#one inside.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.629#And he continued his timid, caressing complaints. She was no longer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.630#listening to him, rocked into dreamland by this declaration of love, her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.631#looks wandering over the roofs of The Ladies' Paradise. To the right
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.632#and the left of the glazed gallery, other galleries, other halls, were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.633#glistening in the sun, between the tops of the houses, pierced with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.634#windows and running along symmetrically, like the wings of a barracks.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.635#Immense metallic works rose up, ladders, bridges, describing a lacework
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.636#of iron in the air; whilst the kitchen chimneys threw out an immense
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.637#volume of smoke like a factory, and the great square cistern, supported
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.638#in the air on wrought-iron pillars, assumed a strange, barbarous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.639#profile, hoisted up to this height by the pride of one man. In the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.640#distance, Paris was roaring.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.641#When Denise returned from this dreamy state, from this fanciful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.642#development of The Ladies' Paradise, in which her thoughts floated as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.643#in a vast solitude, she found that Deloche had seized her hand. And he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.644#appeared so woe-begone, so full of grief, that she had not the heart to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.645#draw it away.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.646#“Forgive me,” he murmured. “It's all over now; I should be quite too
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.647#miserable if you punished me by withdrawing your friendship. I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.648#assure you I intended to say something else. Yes, I had determined to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.649#understand the situation and be very good.” His tears again began to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.650#flow, he tried to steady his voice. “For I know my lot in life. It is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.651#too late for my luck to turn. Beaten at home, beaten in Paris, beaten
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.652#everywhere. I've now been here four years and am still the last in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.653#department So I wanted to tell you not to trouble on my account. I won't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.654#annoy you any longer. Try to be happy, love some one else; yes, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.655#would really be a pleasure for me. If you are happy, I shall be also.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.656#That will be my happiness.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.657#He could say no more. As if to seal his promise he raised the young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.658#girl's hand to his lips--kissing it with the humble kiss of a slave. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.659#was deeply affected, and said simply, in a tender, sisterly tone, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.660#attenuated somewhat the pity of the words:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.661#“My poor boy!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.662#But they started, and turned round; Mouret was standing before them.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.663#For the last ten minutes, Jouve had been searching for the governor all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.664#over the place; but the latter was looking at the works going on for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.665#new façade in the Rue du Dix-Décembre. He spent long hours there every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.666#day, trying to interest himself in this work, of which he had so long
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.667#dreamed. This was his refuge against his torments, amidst the masons
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.668#laying the immense corner-stones, and the engineers setting up the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.669#great iron framework. The façade already appeared above the level of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.670#street, indicating the vast porch, and the windows of the first storey,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.671#a palace-like development in its crude state. He scaled the ladders,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.672#discussing with the architect the ornamentation which was to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.673#something quite new, scrambled over the heaps of brick and iron, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.674#even went down into the cellar; and the roar of the steam-engine, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.675#tic-tac of the trowels, the noise of the hammers, the clamour of this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.676#people of workmen, all over this immense cage surrounded by sonorous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.677#planks, really distracted him for an instant. He came out white with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.678#plaster, black with iron-filings, his feet splashed by the water from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.679#the pumps, his pain so far from being cured that his anguish returned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.680#and his heart beat stronger than ever, as the noise of the works died
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.681#away behind him. It so happened, on the day in question, a slight
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.682#distraction had restored him his gaiety, and he was deeply interested
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.683#in an album of drawings of the mosaics and enamelled terra-cottas which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.684#were to decorate the friezes, when Jouve came up to fetch him, out of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.685#breath, annoyed at being obliged to dirty his coat amongst all this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.686#building material. At first Mouret had cried out that they must
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.687#wait; then, at a word spoken in a low tone by the inspector, he had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.688#immediately followed him, shivering, a prey again to his passion.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.689#Nothing else existed, the façade crumbled away before being built; what
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.690#was the use of this supreme triumph of his pride, if the simple name of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.691#a woman whispered in his ear tortured him to this extent.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.692#Upstairs, Bourdoncle and Jouve thought it prudent to vanish. Deloche
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.693#had already run away, Denise alone remained to face Mouret, paler than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.694#usual, but looking straight into his eyes.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.695#“Have the kindness to follow me, mademoiselle,” said he in a harsh
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.696#voice.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.697#She followed him, they descended the two storeys, and crossed the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.698#furniture and carpet departments without saying a word. When he arrived
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.699#at his office, he opened the door wide, saying, “Walk in, mademoiselle.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.700#And, closing the door, he went to his desk. The new director's office
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.701#was fitted up more luxuriously than the old one, the reps hangings had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.702#been replaced by velvet ones, and a book-case, incrusted with ivory,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.703#occupied one whole side; but on the walls there was still no picture but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.704#the portrait of Madame Hédouin, a young woman with a handsome calm face,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.705#smiling in its gold frame.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.706#“Mademoiselle,” said he at last, trying to maintain a cold, severe
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.707#air, “there are certain things that we cannot tolerate. Good conduct is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.708#absolutely necessary here.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.709#He stopped, choosing his words, in order not to yield to the furious
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.710#anger which was rising up within him. What! she loved this fellow, this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.711#miserable salesman, the laughingstock of his counter! and it was the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.712#humblest, the most awkward of all that she preferred to him, the master!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.713#for he had seen them, she leaving her hand in his, and he covering that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.714#hand with kisses.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.715#“I've been very good to you, mademoiselle,” continued he, making a fresh
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.716#effort “I little expected to be rewarded in this way.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.717#Denise, immediately on entering, had been attracted by Madame Hédouin's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.718#portrait; and, notwithstanding her great trouble, was still pre-occupied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.719#by it. Every time she came into the director's office her eyes were sure
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.720#to meet those of this lady. She felt almost afraid of her, although
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.721#she knew her to have been very good. This time, she felt her to be a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.722#protection.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.723#“You are right, sir,” he said, softly, “I was wrong to stop and talk,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.724#and I beg your pardon for doing so. This young man comes from my part of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.725#the country.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.726#“I'll dismiss him!” cried Mouret, putting all his suffering into this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.727#furious cry.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.728#And, completely overcome, entirely forgetting his position as a director
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.729#lecturing a saleswoman guilty of an infraction of the rules, he broke
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.730#out into a torrent of violent words. Had she no shame in her? a young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.731#girl like her abandoning herself to such a being! and he even made most
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.732#atrocious accusations, introducing Hutin's name into the affair, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.733#then others, in such a flood of words, that she could not even defend
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.734#herself. But he would make a clean sweep, and kick them all out. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.735#severe explanation he had promised himself, when following Jouve, had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.736#degenerated into the shameful violence of a scene of jealousy.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.737#“Yes, your lovers! They told me about it, and I was stupid enough to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.738#doubt it But I was the only one! I was the only one!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.739#Denise, suffocating, bewildered, stood listening to these frightful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.740#charges, which she had not at first understood. Did he really suppose
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.741#her to be as bad as this? At another remark, harsher than all the rest,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.742#she silently turned towards the door. And, in reply to a movement he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.743#made to stop her, said:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.744#“Let me alone, sir, I'm going away. If you think me what you say, I will
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.745#not remain in the house another second.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.746#But he rushed in front of the door, exclaiming: “Why don't you defend
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.747#yourself? Say something!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.748#She stood there very stiff, maintaining an icy silence. For a long time
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.749#he pressed her with questions, with a growing anxiety; and the mute
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.750#dignity of this innocent girl once more appeared to be the artful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.751#calculation of a woman learned in all the tactics of passion. She could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.752#not have played a game better calculated to bring him to her feet,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.753#tortured by doubt, desirous of being convinced.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.754#“Come, you say he is from your part of the country? Perhaps you've met
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.755#there formerly. Swear that there has been nothing between you and this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.756#fellow.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.757#And as she obstinately remained silent, as if still wishing to open
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.758#the door and go away, he completely lost his head, and broke out into a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.759#supreme explosion of grief.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.760#“Good heavens! I love you! I love you! Why do you delight in tormenting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.761#me like this? You can see that nothing else exists, that the people
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.762#of whom I speak only touch me through you, and you alone can occupy my
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.763#thoughts. Thinking you were jealous, I gave up all my pleasures. You
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.764#were told I had mistresses; well! I have them no longer; I hardly set
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.765#foot outside. Did I not prefer you at that lady's house? have I not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.766#broken with her to belong solely to you? And I am still waiting for a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.767#word of thanks, a little gratitude. And if you fear that I should return
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.768#to her, you may feel quite easy: she is avenging herself by helping one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.769#of our former salesmen to found a rival establishment. Tell me, must I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.770#go on my knees to touch your heart?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.771#He had come to this. He, who did not tolerate the slightest peccadillo
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.772#with the shopwomen, who turned them out for the least caprice, found
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.773#himself reduced to imploring one of them not to go away, not to abandon
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.774#him in his misery. He held the door against her, ready to forgive her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.775#everything, to shut his eyes, if she merely deigned to lie. And it was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.776#true, he had got thoroughly sick of girls picked up at theatres and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.777#night-houses; he had long since given up Clara and now ceased to visit
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.778#at Madame Desforges's house, where Bouthemont reigned supreme, while
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.779#waiting for the opening of the new shop, The Four Seasons, which was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.780#already filling the newspapers with its advertisements.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.781#“Must I go on my knees?” repeated he, almost choked by suppressed tears.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.782#She stopped him, herself quite unable to conceal her emotion, deeply
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.783#affected by this suffering passion. “You are wrong, sir, to agitate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.784#yourself in this way,” replied she, at last “I assure you that all these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.785#wicked reports are untrue. This poor fellow you have just seen is no
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.786#more guilty than I am.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.787#She said this with her brave, frank air, looking with her bright eyes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.788#straight into his face.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.789#“Very good, I believe you,” murmured he. “I'll not dismiss any of your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.790#comrades, since you take all these people under your protection. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.791#why, then, do you repulse me, if you love no one else?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.792#A sudden constraint, an anxious bashfulness seized the young girl.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.793#“You love some one, don't you?” resumed he, in a trembling voice. “Oh!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.794#you may speak out; I have no claim on your affections. Do you love any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.795#one?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.796#She turned very red, her heart was in her mouth, and she felt all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.797#falsehood impossible before this emotion which was betraying her, this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.798#repugnance for a lie which made the truth appear in her face in spite of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.799#all.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.800#“Yes,” she at last confessed, feebly. “But I beg you to let me go away,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.801#sir, you are torturing me.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.802#She was now suffering in her turn. Was it not enough to have to defend
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.803#herself against him? Was she to be obliged to fight against herself,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.804#against the breath of tenderness which sometimes took away all her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.805#courage? When he spoke to her thus, when she saw him so full of emotion,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.806#so overcome, she hardly knew why she still refused; and it was only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.807#afterwards that she found, in the depths of her healthy, girlish nature,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.808#the pride and the prudence which maintained her intact in her virtuous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.809#resolution. It was by a sort of instinct of happiness that she still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.810#remained so obstinate, to satisfy her need of a quiet life, and not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.811#from any idea of virtue. She would have fallen into this man's arms, her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.812#heart seduced, her flesh overpowered if she had not experienced a sort
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.813#of revolt, almost a feeling of repulsion before the definite bestowal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.814#of her being, ignorant of her future fate. The lover made her afraid,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.815#inspiring her with that fear that all women feel at the approach of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.816#male.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.817#Mouret gave way to a gesture of gloomy discouragement. He could not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.818#understand her. He turned towards his desk, took up some papers and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.819#then laid them down again, saying: “I will retain you no longer,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.820#mademoiselle; I cannot keep you against your will.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.821#“But I don't wish to go away,” replied she, smiling. “If you believe me
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.822#to be innocent, I will remain. One ought always to believe a woman to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.823#virtuous, sir. There are numbers who are so, I assure you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.824#Denise's eyes had involuntarily wandered towards Madame Hédouin's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.825#portrait: that lady so wise and so beautiful, whose blood, they said,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.826#had brought good fortune to the house. Mouret followed the young girl's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.827#look with a start, for he thought he heard his dead wife pronounce this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.828#phrase, one of her own sayings which he at once recognised. And it was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.829#like a resurrection, he discovered in Denise the good sense, the just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.830#equilibrium of her he had lost, even down to the gentle voice, sparing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.831#of useless words. He was struck by this resemblance, which rendered him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.832#sadder still.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.833#“You know I am yours,” murmured he in conclusion. “Do what you like with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.834#me.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.835#Then she resumed gaily: “That is right, sir. The advice of a woman,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.836#however humble she may be, is always worth listening to when she has a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.837#little intelligence. If you put yourself in my hands, be sure I'll make
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.838#nothing but a good man of you!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.839#She smiled, with that simple unassuming air which had such a charm. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.840#also smiled in a feeble way, and escorted her as far as the door, as he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.841#would a lady.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.842#The next day Denise was appointed first-hand. The dress and costume
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.843#department was divided, the management creating especially for her one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.844#for children's costumes, which was installed close to the ready-made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.845#one. Since her son's dismissal, Madame Aurélie had been trembling, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.846#she found the directors getting cool towards her, and saw the young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.847#girl's power increasing daily. Would they not shortly sacrifice her in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.848#favour of this latter, by taking advantage of the first pretext? Her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.849#emperor's mask, puffed up with fat, seemed to have got thinner from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.850#shame which now stained the whole Lhomme dynasty; and she made a show
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.851#of going away every evening on her husband's arm, for they were brought
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.852#nearer together by misfortune, and felt vaguely that the evil came from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.853#the disorder of their home; whilst the poor old man, more affected than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.854#her, in a sickly fear of being himself suspected of robbery, counted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.855#over the receipts, again and again, noisily, performing miracles with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.856#his amputated arm. So that, when she saw Denise appointed first-hand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.857#in the children's costume department, she experienced such joy that she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.858#paraded the most affectionate feeling towards the young girl, really
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.859#grateful to her for not having taken her place away. And she overwhelmed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.860#her with attentions, treating her as an equal, often going to talk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.861#to her in the neighbouring department, with a stately air, like a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.862#queen-mother paying a visit to a young queen.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.863#In fact, Denise was now at the summit. Her appointment as first-hand had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.864#destroyed the last resistance. If some still babbled, from that itching
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.865#of the tongue which ravages every assemblage of men and women, they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.866#bowed very low before her face. Marguerite, now second-hand, was full
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.867#of praise for her. Clara, herself, inspired with a secret respect before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.868#this good fortune, which she felt herself incapable of achieving, had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.869#bowed her head. But Denise's victory was more complete still over the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.870#gentlemen; over Jouve, who now bent almost double whenever he addressed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.871#her; over Hutin, seized with anxiety on feeling his position giving way
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.872#under him; and over Bourdoncle, reduced at last to powerlessness. When
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.873#the latter saw her coming out of the director's office, smiling, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.874#her quiet air, and that the next day Mouret had insisted on the board
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.875#creating this new department, he had yielded, vanquished by a sacred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.876#terror of woman. He had always given in thus before Mouret, recognising
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.877#him to be his master, notwithstanding his escapades and his idiotic
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.878#love affairs. This time the woman had proved the stronger, and he was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.879#expecting to be swept away by the disaster.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.880#However, Denise bore her triumph in a peaceable, charming manner,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.881#happy at these marks of consideration, even affecting to see in them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.882#a sympathy for the miseries of her debut and the final success of her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.883#patient courage. Thus she received with a laughing joy the slightest
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.884#marks of friendship, and this caused her to be really loved by some,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.885#she was so kind, sympathetic, and full of affection. The only person for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.886#whom she still showed an invincible repugnance was Clara, having learned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.887#that this girl had amused herself by taking Colomban home with her one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.888#night as she had said she would do for a joke; and he, carried away
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.889#by his passion, was becoming more dissipated every day, whilst poor
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.890#Geneviève was slowly dying. The adventure was talked of at The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.891#Paradise, and thought very droll.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.892#But this trouble, the only one she had outside, did not in any way
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.893#change Denise's equable temper. It was especially in her department that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.894#she was seen at her best, in the midst of her little world of babies of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.895#all ages. She was passionately fond of children, and she could not have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.896#been placed in a better position. Sometimes there were fully fifty girls
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.897#and as many boys there, quite a turbulent school, let loose in their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.898#growing coquettish desires. The mothers completely lost their heads.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.899#She, conciliating, smiling, had the little ones placed in a line, on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.900#chairs; and when there happened to be amongst the number a rosy-cheeked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.901#little angel, whose pretty face tempted her, she would insist on serving
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.902#her herself, bringing the dress and trying it on the child's dimpled
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.903#shoulders, with the tender precaution of an elder sister. There were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.904#fits of laughter, cries of joy, amidst the scolding voices of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.905#mothers. Sometimes a little girl, already a grand lady, nine or ten
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.906#years old, having a cloth jacket to try on, would stand studying it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.907#before a glass, turning round, with an absorbed air, her eyes sparkling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.908#with a desire to please. The counters were encumbered with the things
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.909#unpacked, dresses in pink and blue Asian linen for children of from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.910#one to five years, blue sailor costumes, with plaited skirt and blouse,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.911#trimmed with fine cambric muslin, Louis XV. costumes, mantles, jackets,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.912#a pell-mell of narrow garments, stiffened in their infantine grace,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.913#something like the cloak-room of a regiment of big dolls, taken out of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.914#the wardrobes and given up to pillage. Denise had always a few sweets
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.915#in her pockets, to appease the tears of some youngster in despair at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.916#not being able to carry off a pair of red trousers; and she lived there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.917#amongst these little ones as in her own family, feeling quite young
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.918#again herself from the contact of all this innocence and freshness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.919#incessantly renewed around her skirts.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.920#She now had frequent friendly conversations with Mouret. When she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.921#went to the office to take orders and furnish information, he kept her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.922#talking, enjoying the sound of her voice. It was what she laughingly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.923#called “making a good man of him.” In her prudent, cautious Norman head
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.924#there sprang up all sorts of projects, ideas about the new business
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.925#which she had already ventured to hint at when at Robineau's, and some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.926#of which she had expressed on the evening of their walk in the Tuileries
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.927#gardens. She could not be occupied in any matter, see any work going on,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.928#without being moved with a desire to introduce some improvement in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.929#mechanism. Then, since her entry into The Ladies' Paradise, she was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.930#especially pained by the precarious position of the employees; the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.931#sudden dismissals shocked her, she thought them iniquitous and stupid,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.932#hurtful to all, to the house as much as to the staff. Her former
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.933#sufferings were still fresh in her mind, and her heart was seized with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.934#pity every time she saw a new comer, her feet bruised, her eyes dim with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.935#tears, dragging herself along in her misery in her silk dress, amidst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.936#the spiteful persecution of the old hands. This dog's life made the best
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.937#of them bad; and the sad work of destruction commenced: all eaten up by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.938#the trade before the age of forty, disappearing, falling into unknown
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.939#places, a great many dying in harness, some of consumption and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.940#exhaustion, others of fatigue and bad air, a few thrown on the street,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.941#the happiest married, buried in some little provincial shop. Was it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.942#humane, was it just, this frightful consumption of human life that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.943#the big shops carried on every year? And she pleaded the cause of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.944#wheel-work of the colossal machine, not from any sentimental reasons,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.945#but by arguments appealing to the very interests of the employers. To
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.946#make a machine solid and strong, it is necessary to use good iron; if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.947#the iron breaks or is broken, there is a stoppage of work, repeated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.948#expenses of starting, quite a loss of power.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.949#Sometimes she would become quite animated, she would picture an immense
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.950#ideal bazaar, the phalansterium of modern commerce, in which each one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.951#should have his exact share of the profits, according to his merits,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.952#with the certainty of the future, assured to him by a contract Mouret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.953#would feel amused at this, notwithstanding his fever. He accused her of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.954#socialism, embarrassed her by pointing out the difficulties of carrying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.955#out these schemes; for she spoke in the simplicity of her soul, bravely
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.956#trusting in the future, when she perceived a dangerous hole underlying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.957#her tender-hearted plans. He was, however, shaken, captivated by this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.958#young voice, still trembling from the evils endured, so convinced and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.959#earnest in pointing out the reforms which would tend to consolidate the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.960#house; yet he listened while joking with her; the salesmen's position
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.961#gradually improved, the wholesale dismissals were replaced by a system
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.962#of holidays granted during the dead seasons, and there was also about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.963#to be created a sort of benefit club which would protect the employees
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.964#against bad times and ensure them a pension. It was the embryo of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.965#vast trades' unions of the twentieth century.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.966#Denise did not confine her attention solely to healing the wounds from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.967#which she had herself bled; she conceived various delicate feminine
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.968#ideas, which, communicated to Mouret, delighted the customers. She also
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.969#caused Lhomme's happiness by supporting a scheme he had long nourished,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.970#that of creating a band of music, in which all the executants should be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.971#chosen from amongst the staff. Three months later Lhomme had a hundred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.972#and twenty musicians under his direction, the dream of his whole life
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.973#was realised. And a grand fête was given on the premises, a concert and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.974#a ball, to introduce the band of The Ladies' Paradise to the customers
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.975#and the whole world. The newspapers took the matter up, Bourdoncle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.976#himself, frightened by these innovations, was obliged to bow before this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.977#immense advertisement. Afterwards, a recreation room for the men was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.978#established, with two billiard tables and backgammon and chess boards.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.979#Then classes were held in the house of an evening; there were lessons in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.980#English and German, in grammar, arithmetic, and geography; they even
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.981#had lessons in riding and fencing. A library was formed, ten thousand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.982#volumes were placed at the disposal of the employees. And a resident
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.983#doctor giving consultations gratis was also added, together with baths,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.984#and hair-dressing and refreshment saloons. Every want in life
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.985#was provided for, everything was to be obtained without going
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.986#outside--board, lodging, and clothing. The Ladies' Paradise sufficed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.987#entirely for all its own wants and pleasures, in the very heart of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.988#Paris, taken up by all this clatter, by this working city which was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.989#springing up so vigorously out of the ruins of the old streets, at last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.990#opened to the rays of the sun.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.991#Then a fresh movement of opinion took place in Denise's favour. As
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.992#Bourdoncle, vanquished, repeated with despair to his friends that he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.993#would give a great deal to put Denise into Mouret's arms himself, it was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.994#concluded that she had not yielded, that her all-powerfulness resulted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.995#from her refusal. From that moment she became immensely popular. They
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.996#knew for what indulgences they were indebted to her, and they admired
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.997#her for the force of her will. There was one, at least, who could master
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.998#the governor, who avenged all the others, and knew how to get something
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.999#else besides promises out of him! So she had come at last, she who was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1000#to make him treat the poor devils with a little respect! When she went
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1001#through the shop, with her delicate, self-willed head, her tender,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1002#invincible air, the salesmen smiled at her, were proud of her, and would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1003#willingly have exhibited her to the crowd. Denise, in her happiness,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1004#allowed herself to be carried along by this increasing sympathy. Was it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1005#all possible? She saw herself arrive in a poor dress, frightened, lost
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1006#amidst the mechanism of the terrible machine; for a long time she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1007#had the sensation of being nothing, hardly a grain of seed beneath these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1008#millstones which were crushing a whole world; and now to-day she was the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1009#very soul of this world, she alone was of consequence, able at a word to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1010#increase or slacken the pace of the colossus lying at her feet. And yet
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1011#she had not wished for these things, she had simply presented herself,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1012#without calculation, with the sole charm of her sweetness. Her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1013#sovereignty sometimes caused her an uneasy surprise; why did they all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1014#obey her? she was not pretty, she did nothing wrong. Then she smiled,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1015#her heart at rest, feeling within herself nothing but goodness and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1016#prudence, a love of truth and logic which constituted all her strength.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1017#One of Denise's greatest joys was to be able to assist Pauline. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1018#latter, being about to become a mother, was trembling, aware that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1019#two other saleswomen in the same condition had been sent away. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1020#principals did not tolerate these accidents, maternity being suppressed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1021#as cumbersome and indecent; they occasionally allowed marriage, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1022#would admit of no children. Pauline had, it was true, her husband in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1023#house; but still she felt anxious, it being almost impossible for her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1024#to appear at the counter; and in order to postpone a probable dismissal,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1025#she laced herself very tightly, resolved to conceal her state as long
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1026#as she could. One of the two saleswomen who had been dismissed, had just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1027#been delivered of a still-born child, through having laced herself up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1028#in this way; and it was not certain that she herself would recover.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1029#Meanwhile, Bourdoncle had observed that Pauline's complexion was getting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1030#very livid, and that she had a painfully stiff way of walking. One
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1031#morning he was standing near her, in the under-linen department, when a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1032#messenger, taking away a bundle, ran up against her with such force that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1033#she cried out with pain. Bourdoncle immediately took her on one side,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1034#made her confess, and submitted the question of her dismissal to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1035#board, under the pretext that she stood in need of country air: the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1036#story of this accident would spread, and would have a disastrous effect
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1037#on the public if she should have a miscarriage, as had already taken
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1038#place in the baby linen department the year before. Mouret, who was not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1039#at the meeting, could only give his opinion in the evening. But Denise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1040#having had time to interfere, he closed Bourdoncle's mouth, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1041#interest of the house itself. Did they wish to frighten the heads of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1042#families and the young mothers amongst their customers? And it was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1043#decided, with great pomp, that every married saleswoman should, when in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1044#the family way, be sent to a special midwife's as soon as her presence
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1045#at the counter became offensive to the customers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1046#The next day when Denise went up into the infirmary to see Pauline,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1047#who had been obliged to take to her bed on account of the blow she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1048#received, the latter kissed her violently on both cheeks. “How kind you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1049#are! Had it not been for you I should have been turned away. Pray don't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1050#be anxious about me, the doctor says it's nothing.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1051#Bauge, who had slipped away from his department, was also there, on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1052#other side of the bed. He likewise stammered his thanks, troubled before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1053#Denise, whom he now treated as an important person, of a superior class.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1054#Ah! if he heard any more nasty remarks about her, he would soon close
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1055#the mouths of the jealous ones! But Pauline sent him away with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1056#good-natured shrug of the shoulders.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1057#“My poor darling, you're always saying something stupid. Leave us to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1058#talk together.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1059#The infirmary was a long, light room, containing twelve beds, with their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1060#white curtains. Those who did not wish to go home to their families were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1061#nursed here. But on the day in question, Pauline was the only occupant,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1062#in a bed near one of the large windows which looked on to the Rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1063#Neuve-Saint-Augustin. And they immediately commenced to exchange
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1064#whispered words, tender confidences, in the calm air, perfumed with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1065#vague odour of lavender.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1066#“So he does just what you wish him to? How cruel you are, to make him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1067#suffer so! Come, just explain it to me, now I've ventured to approach
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1068#the subject. Do you detest him?” Pauline had retained hold of Denise's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1069#hand, as the latter sat near the bed, with her elbow on the bolster; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1070#overcome by a sudden emotion, her cheeks invaded with colour, she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1071#a moment of weakness at this direct and unexpected question. Her secret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1072#escaped her, she buried her head in the pillow, murmuring:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1073#“I love him!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1074#Pauline was astonished. “What! you love him? But it's very simple: say
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1075#yes.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1076#Denise, her face still concealed, replied “No!” by an energetic shake of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1077#the head. And she did so, simply because she loved him, without being
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1078#able to explain the matter. No doubt it was ridiculous; but she felt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1079#like that, she could not change her nature. Her friend's surprise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1080#increased, and she at length asked: “So it's all to make him marry you?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1081#At this the young girl sprung up, quite confused: “Marry me! Oh! no!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1082#Oh! I assure you that I have never wished for anything of the kind! No,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1083#never has such an idea entered my head; and you know what a horror I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1084#have of all falsehood!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1085#“Well, dear,” resumed Pauline, kindly, “you couldn't have acted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1086#otherwise, if such had been your intention. All this must come to an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1087#end, and it is very certain that it can only finish by a marriage, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1088#you won't let it be otherwise. I must tell you that every one has the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1089#same idea; yes, they feel persuaded that you are riding the high horse,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1090#in order to make him take you to church. Dear me! what a funny girl you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1091#are!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1092#And she had to console Denise, who had again dropped her head on to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1093#bolster, sobbing, declaring that she would certainly go away, since they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1094#attributed all sorts of things to her that had never crossed her mind.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1095#No doubt, when a man loved a woman he ought to marry her. But she asked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1096#for nothing, she had made no calculations, she simply begged to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1097#allowed to live quietly, with her joys and her sorrows, like other
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1098#people. She would go away.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1099#At the same moment Mouret was going through the premises below. He had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1100#wanted to forget his thoughts by visiting the works once more. Several
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1101#months had elapsed, the façade now reared its monumental lines behind
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1102#the vast hoardings which concealed it from the public. Quite an army of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1103#decorators were at work: marble-cutters, mosaic-workers, and others. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1104#central group above the door was being gilded; whilst on the acroteria
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1105#were being fixed the pedestals destined to receive the statues of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1106#manufacturing cities of France. From morning to night, in the Rue du
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1107#Dix-Décembre, lately opened to the public, a crowd of idlers stood
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1108#gaping about, their noses in the air, seeing nothing, but pre-occupied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1109#by the marvels that were related of this façade, the inauguration of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1110#which was going to revolutionise Paris. And it was on this feverish
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1111#working-ground, amidst the artists putting the finishing touches to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1112#realisation of his dream commenced by the masons, that Mouret felt more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1113#bitterly than ever the vanity of his fortune. The thought of Denise had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1114#suddenly arrested him, this thought which incessantly pierced him with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1115#a flame, like the shooting of an incurable pain. He had run away, unable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1116#to find a word of satisfaction, fearful lest he should show his tears,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1117#leaving behind him the disgust of his triumph. This façade, which was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1118#at last erected, seemed little in his eyes, very much like one of those
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1119#walls of sand that children build, and it might have been extended from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1120#one end of the city to the other, elevated to the starry sky, yet it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1121#would not have filled the emptiness of his heart, that the “yes” of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1122#mere child could alone fill.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1123#When Mouret entered his office he was almost choking with sobs. What did
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1124#she want? He dared not offer her money now; and the confused idea of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1125#marriage presented itself amidst his young widower's revolts. And, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1126#the debility of his powerlessness, his tears began to flow. He was very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xii.1127#miserable.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.1#CHAPTER XIII.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.2#One morning in November, Denise was giving her first orders in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.3#department when the Baudus' servant came to tell her that Mademoiselle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.4#Geneviève had passed a very bad night, and wished to see her cousin
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.5#immediately. For some time the young girl had been getting weaker and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.6#weaker, and she had been obliged to take to her bed two days before.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.7#“Say I am coming at once,” replied Denise, very anxious.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.8#The blow which was finishing Genevieve was Colomban's sudden
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.9#disappearance. At first, chaffed by Clara, he had stopped out several
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.10#nights; then, yielding to the mad desires of a quiet, chaste fellow, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.11#had become her obedient slave, and had not returned one Monday, but had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.12#simply sent a farewell letter to Baudu, written in the studied terms of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.13#a man about to commit suicide. Perhaps, at the bottom of this passion,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.14#there was also the crafty calculation of a fellow delighted at escaping
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.15#a disastrous marriage. The draper's business was in as bad a way as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.16#his betrothed; the moment was propitious to break with them through any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.17#stupidity. And every one cited him as an unfortunate victim of love.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.18#When Denise arrived at The Old Elbeuf, Madame Baudu was there alone,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.19#sitting motionless behind the pay-desk, with her small white face, eaten
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.20#up by anæmia, silent and quiet in the cold, deserted shop. There were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.21#no assistants now. The servant dusted the shelves, and it was even a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.22#question of replacing her by a charwoman. A dreary cold fell from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.23#ceiling, hours passed away without a customer coming to disturb this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.24#silence, and the goods, no longer touched, became mustier and mustier
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.25#every day.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.26#“What's the matter?” asked Denise, anxiously. “Is Geneviève in danger?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.27#Madame Baudu did not reply at first. Her eyes filled with tears. Then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.28#she stammered: “I don't know; they don't tell me anything. Ah, it's all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.29#over, it's all over.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.30#And she cast a sombre glance around the dark old shop, as if she felt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.31#her daughter and the shop disappearing together. The seventy thousand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.32#francs, produce of the sale of their Rambouillet property, had melted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.33#away in less than two years in this gulf of competition. In order to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.34#struggle against The Ladies' Paradise, which now kept men's cloths and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.35#materials for hunting and livery suits, the draper had made considerable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.36#sacrifices. At last he had been definitely crushed by the swanskin cloth
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.37#and flannels sold by his rival, an assortment that had not its equal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.38#in the market. Little by little his debts had increased, and, as a last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.39#resource, he had resolved to mortgage the old building in the Rue de la
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.40#Michodière, where Finet, their ancestor, had founded the business; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.41#it was now only a question of days, the crumbling away had commenced,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.42#the very ceilings seemed to be falling down and turning into dust, like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.43#an old worm-eaten structure carried away by the wind.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.44#“Your uncle is upstairs,” resumed Madame Baudu in her broken voice. “We
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.45#stay with her two hours each. Some one must look out here; oh! but only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.46#as a precaution, for to tell the truths----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.47#Her gesture finished the phrase. They would have put the shutters up had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.48#it not been for their old commercial pride, which still propped them up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.49#in the presence of the neighbourhood.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.50#“Well, I'll go up, aunt,” said Denise, whose heart was bleeding, amidst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.51#this resigned despair that even the pieces of cloth themselves exhaled.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.52#“Yes, go upstairs quick, my girl. She's waiting for you. She's been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.53#asking for you all night. She has something to tell you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.54#But just at that moment Baudu came down. The rising bile gave his yellow
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.55#face a greenish tinge, and his eyes were bloodshot. He was still walking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.56#with the muffled step with which he had quitted the Sick room, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.57#murmur-ed, as if he might be heard upstairs, “She's asleep.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.58#And, thoroughly worn out, he sat down on a chair, wiping his forehead
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.59#with a mechanical gesture, puffing like a man who has just finished some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.60#hard work. A silence ensued, but at last he said to Denise: “You'll see
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.61#her presently. When she is sleeping, she seems to me to be all right
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.62#again.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.63#There was again a silence. Face to face, the father and mother stood
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.64#looking at each other. Then, in a half whisper, he went over his grief
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.65#again, naming no one, addressing no one directly: “My head on the block,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.66#I wouldn't have believed it! He was the last one. I had brought him up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.67#as a son. If any one had come and said to me, 'They'll take him away
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.68#from you as well; he'll fall as well,' I would have replied 'Impossible,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.69#it could not be.' And he has fallen all the same! Ah! the scoundrel, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.70#who was so well up in real business, who had all my ideas! And all for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.71#a young monkey, one of those dummies that parade at the windows of bad
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.72#houses! No! really, it's enough to drive one mad!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.73#He shook his head, his eyes fell on the damp floor worn away by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.74#generations of customers. Then he continued in a lower voice, “There are
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.75#moments when I feel myself the most culpable of all in our misfortune.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.76#Yes, it's my fault if our poor girl is upstairs devoured by fever. Ought
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.77#not I to have married them at once, without yielding to my stupid pride,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.78#my obstinacy in refusing to leave them the house less prosperous than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.79#before? Had I done that she would now have the man she loved, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.80#perhaps their united youthful strength would have accomplished the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.81#miracle that I have failed to work. But I am an old fool, and saw
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.82#through nothing; I didn't know that people fell ill over such things.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.83#Really he was an extraordinary fellow: with such a gift for business,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.84#and such probity, such simplicity of conduct, so orderly in every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.85#way--in short, my pupil.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.86#He raised his head, still defending his ideas, in the person of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.87#shopman who had betrayed him. Denise could not bear to hear him accuse
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.88#himself, and she told him so, carried away by her emotion, on seeing him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.89#so humble, with his eyes full of tears, he who used formerly to reign as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.90#absolute master.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.91#“Uncle, pray don't apologise for him. He never loved Geneviève, he would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.92#have run away sooner if you had tried to hasten the marriage. I have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.93#spoken to him myself about it; he was perfectly well aware that my
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.94#cousin was suffering on his account, and you see that did not prevent
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.95#him leaving. Ask aunt.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.96#Without opening her lips, Madame Baudu confirmed these words by a nod.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.97#The draper turned paler still, blinded by his tears. He stammered out:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.98#“It must be in the blood, his father died last year through having led a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.99#dissolute life.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.100#And he once more looked round the obscure shop, his eyes wandering from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.101#the empty counters to the full shelves, then resting on Madame Baudu,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.102#who was still at the pay-desk, waiting in vain for the customers who did
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.103#not come.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.104#“Come,” said he, “it's all over. They've ruined our business, and now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.105#one of their hussies is killing our daughter.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.106#No one spoke. The rolling of the vehicles, which occasionally shook the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.107#floor, passed like a funereal beating of drums in the still air, stifled
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.108#under the low ceiling. Suddenly, amidst this gloomy sadness of the old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.109#dying shop, could be heard several heavy knocks, struck somewhere in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.110#the house. It was Geneviève, who had just awoke, and was knocking with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.111#stick they had left near her bed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.112#“Let's go up at once,” said Baudu, rising with a start. “Try and be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.113#cheerful, she mustn't know.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.114#He himself rubbed his eyes to efface the trace of his tears. As soon as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.115#he had opened the door, on the first storey, they heard a frightened,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.116#feeble voice crying: “Oh, I don't like to be left alone. Don't leave me;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.117#I'm afraid to be left alone.” Then, when she perceived Denise, Geneviève
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.118#became calmer, and smiled joyfully. “You've come, then! How I've been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.119#longing to see you since yesterday. I thought you also had abandoned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.120#me!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.121#It was a piteous sight. The young girl's room looked out on to the yard,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.122#a little room lighted by a livid light At first her parents had put her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.123#in their own room, in the front; but the sight of The Ladies' Paradise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.124#opposite affected her so much, that they had been obliged to bring
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.125#her back to her own again. And there she lay, so very thin, under the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.126#bed-clothes, that one hardly suspected the form and existence of a human
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.127#body. Her skinny arms, consumed by a burning fever, were in a perpetual
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.128#movement of anxious, unconscious searching; whilst her black hair seemed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.129#thicker still, and to be eating up her poor face with its voracious
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.130#vitality, that face in which was agonising the final degenerateness of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.131#a family sprung up in the shade, in this cellar of old commercial Paris.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.132#Denise, her heart bursting with pity, stood looking at her. She did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.133#at first speak, for fear of giving way to tears. At last she murmured:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.134#“I came at once. Can I be of any use to you? You asked for me. Would you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.135#like me to stay?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.136#“No, thanks. I don't want anything. I only wanted to embrace you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.137#Tears filled her eyes. Denise quickly leant over, and kissed her on both
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.138#cheeks, trembling to feel on her lips the flame of those hollow cheeks.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.139#But Geneviève, stretching out her arms, seized and kept her in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.140#desperate embrace. Then she looked towards her father.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.141#“Would you like me to stay?” repeated Denise. “Perhaps there is
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.142#something I can do for you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.143#Geneviève's glance was still obstinately fixed on her father, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.144#remained standing, with a stolid air, almost choking. He at last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.145#understood, and went away, without saying a word; and they heard his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.146#heavy footstep on the stairs.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.147#“Tell me, is he with that woman?” asked the sick girl immediately,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.148#seizing her cousin's hand, and making her sit on the side of the bed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.149#“I want to know, and you are the only one can tell me. They're living
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.150#together, aren't they?” Denise, surprised by these questions, stammered,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.151#and was obliged to confess the truth, the rumours that were current in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.152#the shop. Clara, tired of this fellow, who was getting a nuisance to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.153#her, had already broken with him, and Colomban, desolated, was pursuing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.154#her everywhere, trying to obtain a meeting from time to time, with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.155#sort of canine humility. They said that he was going to take a situation
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.156#at the Grands Magasins du Louvre.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.157#“If you still love him, he may return,” said Denise, to cheer the dying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.158#girl with this last hope. “Get well quick, he will acknowledge his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.159#errors, and marry you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.160#Geneviève interrupted her. She had listened with all her soul, with an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.161#intense passion that raised her in the bed. But she fell back almost
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.162#immediately. “No, I know it's all over! I don't say anything, because I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.163#see papa crying, and I don't wish to make mamma worse than she is. But I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.164#am going, Denise, and if I called for you last night it was for fear of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.165#going off before the morning. And to think that he is not happy after
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.166#all!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.167#And Denise having remonstrated, assuring her that she was not so bad as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.168#all that, she cut her short again, suddenly throwing off the bed-clothes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.169#with the chaste gesture of a virgin who has nothing to conceal in death.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.170#Naked to the waist, she murmured: “Look at me! Is it possible?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.171#Trembling, Denise quitted the side of the bed, as if she feared to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.172#destroy this fearful nudity with a breath. It was the last of the flesh,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.173#a bride's body used up by waiting, returned to the first infantile
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.174#slimness of her young days. Geneviève slowly covered herself up again,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.175#saying: “You see I am no longer a woman. It would be wrong to wish for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.176#him still!” There was a silence. Both continued to look at each other,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.177#unable to find a word to say. It was Geneviève who resumed: “Come, don't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.178#stay any longer, you have your own affairs to look after. And thanks, I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.179#was tormented by the wish to know, and am now satisfied. If you see him,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.180#tell him I forgive him. Adieu, dear Denise. Kiss me once more, for it's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.181#the last time.” The young girl kissed her, protesting: “No, no, don't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.182#despair, all you want is loving care, nothing more.” But the sick girl,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.183#shaking her head in an obstinate way, smiled, quite sure of what she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.184#said. And as her cousin was making for the door, she exclaimed: “Wait a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.185#minute, knock with this stick, so that papa may come up. I'm afraid to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.186#stay alone.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.187#Then, when Baudu arrived in that small, gloomy room, where he spent
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.188#hours seated on a chair, she assumed an air of gaiety, saying to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.189#Denise--“Don't come to-morrow, I would rather not. But on Sunday I shall
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.190#expect you; you can spend the afternoon with me.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.191#The next morning, at six o'clock, Geneviève expired after four hours'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.192#fearful agony. The funeral took place on a Saturday, a fearfully black,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.193#gloomy day, under a sooty sky which hung over the shivering city. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.194#Old Elbeuf, hung with white linen, lighted up the street with a bright
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.195#spot, and the candles burning in the fading day seemed so many stars
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.196#drowned in the twilight The coffin was covered with wreaths and bouquets
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.197#of white roses; it was a narrow child's coffin, placed in the obscure
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.198#passage of the house on a level with the pavement, so near the gutter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.199#that the passing carriages had already splashed the coverings. The whole
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.200#neighbourhood exhaled a dampness, a cellar-like mouldy odour, with its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.201#continual rush of pedestrians on the muddy pavement.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.202#At nine o'clock Denise came over to stay with her aunt. But as the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.203#funeral was starting, the latter--who had ceased weeping, her eyes burnt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.204#with tears--begged her to follow the body and look after her uncle,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.205#whose mute affliction and almost idiotic grief filled the family with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.206#anxiety. Below, the young girl found the street full of people, for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.207#small traders in the neighbourhood were anxious to show the Baudus
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.208#a mark of sympathy, and in this eagerness there was also a sort of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.209#manifestation against The Ladies' Paradise, whom they accused of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.210#causing Geneviève's slow agony. All the victims of the monster were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.211#there--Bédoré and sister from the hosier's shop in the Rue Gaillon, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.212#furriers, Vanpouille Brothers, and Deslignières the toyman, and Piot
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.213#and Rivoire the furniture dealers; even Mademoiselle Tatin from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.214#underclothing shop, and the glover Quinette, long since cleared off by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.215#bankruptcy, had made it a duty to come, the one from Batignolle, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.216#other from the Bastille, where they had been obliged to take situations.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.217#Whilst waiting for the hearse, which was late, these people, tramping
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.218#about in the mud, cast glances of hatred towards The Ladies' Paradise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.219#the bright windows and gay displays of which seemed an insult in face
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.220#of The Old Elbeuf, which, with its funeral trappings and glimmering
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.221#candles, cast a gloom over the other side of the street A few curious
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.222#faces appeared at the plate-glass windows; but the colossus maintained
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.223#the indifference of a machine going at full speed, unconscious of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.224#deaths it may cause on the road.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.225#Denise looked round for her brother Jean, whom she at last perceived
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.226#standing before Bourras's shop, and she went and asked him to walk with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.227#his uncle, to assist him if he could not get along. For the last few
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.228#weeks Jean had been very grave, as if tormented by some worry. To-day,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.229#buttoned up in his black frock-coat, a full grown man, earning his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.230#twenty francs a day, he seemed so dignified and so sad that his sister
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.231#was surprised, for she had no idea he loved his cousin so much as that.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.232#Desirous of sparing Pépé this needless grief, she had left him with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.233#Madame Gras, intending to go and fetch him in the afternoon to see his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.234#uncle and aunt.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.235#The hearse had still not arrived, and Denise, greatly affected, was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.236#watching the candles burn, when she was startled by a well-known voice
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.237#behind her. It was Bourras. He had called the chestnut-seller opposite,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.238#in his little box, against the public-house, and said to him:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.239#“I say, Vigouroux, just keep a look-out for me a bit, will you? You see
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.240#I've closed the door. If any one comes tell them to call again. But don't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.241#let that disturb you, no one will come.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.242#Then he took his stand on the pavement, waiting like the others. Denise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.243#feeling rather awkward, glanced at his shop. He entirely abandoned it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.244#now; there was nothing left but a disorderly array of umbrellas eaten up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.245#by the damp air, and canes blackened by the gas. The embellishments
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.246#that he had made, the delicate green paint work, the glasses, the gilded
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.247#sign, were all cracking, already getting dirty, presenting that rapid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.248#and lamentable decrepitude of false luxury laid over ruins. But though
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.249#the old crevices were re-appearing, though the spots of damp had sprung
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.250#up over the gildings, the house still held its ground obstinately,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.251#hanging on to the flanks of The Ladies' Paradise like a dishonouring
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.252#wart, which, although cracked and rotten, refused to fall off.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.253#“Ah! the scoundrels,” growled Bourras, “they won't even let her be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.254#carried away.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.255#The hearse, which had at last arrived, had just got into collision with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.256#one of The Ladies' Paradise vans, which was spinning along, shedding in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.257#the mist its starry radiance, with the rapid trot of two superb horses.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.258#And the old man cast on Denise an oblique glance, lighted up under his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.259#bushy eyebrows. Slowly, the funeral started off, splashing through the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.260#muddy pools, amid the silence of the omnibuses and carriages suddenly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.261#pulled up. When the coffin, draped with white, crossed the Place
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.262#Gaillon, the sombre looks of the cortege were once more plunged into the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.263#windows of the big shop, where two saleswomen alone had run up to look
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.264#on, pleased at this distraction. Baudu followed the hearse with a heavy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.265#mechanical step, refusing by a sign the arm offered by Jean, who was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.266#walking with him. Then, after a long-string of people, came three
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.267#mourning coaches. As they passed the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.268#Robineau ran up to join the cortege, very pale, and looking much older.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.269#At Saint-Roch, a great many women were waiting, the small traders of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.270#the neighbourhood, who had been afraid of the crowd at the house. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.271#manifestation was developing into quite a riot; and when, after the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.272#service, the procession started off back, all the men followed, although
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.273#it was a long walk from the Rue Saint-Honoré to the Montmartre Cemetery.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.274#They had to go up the Rue Saint-Roch, and once more pass The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.275#Paradise. It was a sort of obsession; this poor young girl's body was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.276#paraded round the big shop like the first victim fallen in time of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.277#revolution. At the door some red flannels were flapping like so many
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.278#flags, and a display of carpets blazed forth in a florescence of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.279#enormous roses and full-blown pæonies. Denise had got into one of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.280#coaches, being agitated by some smarting doubts, her heart oppressed by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.281#such a feeling of grief that she had not the strength to walk At
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.282#that moment there was a stop, in the Rue du Dix-Décembre, before the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.283#scaffolding of the new façade which still obstructed the thoroughfare.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.284#'And the young girl observed old Bourras, left behind, dragging along
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.285#with difficulty, close to the wheels of the coach in which she was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.286#riding alone. He would never get as far as the cemetery, she thought. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.287#raised his head, looked at her, and all at once got into the coach.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.288#“It's my confounded knees,” exclaimed he. “Don't draw back! Is it you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.289#that we detest?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.290#She felt him to be friendly and furious as in former days. He grumbled,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.291#declared that Baudu must be fearfully strong to be able to keep up after
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.292#such blows as he had received. The procession had resumed its slow pace;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.293#and on leaning out, Denise saw her uncle walking with his heavy step,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.294#which seemed to regulate the rumbling and painful march of the cortege.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.295#She then threw herself back into the corner, listening to the endless
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.296#complaints of the old umbrella maker, rocked by the melancholy movement
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.297#of the coach.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.298#“The police ought to clear the public thoroughfare, my word! They've
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.299#been blocking up our street for the last eighteen months with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.300#scaffolding of their façade, where a man was killed the other day. Never
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.301#mind! When they want to enlarge further they'll have to throw bridges
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.302#over the street. They say there are now two thousand seven hundred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.303#employees, and that the business will amount to a hundred millions this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.304#year. A hundred millions! Just fancy, a hundred millions!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.305#Denise had nothing to say in reply. The procession had just turned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.306#into the Rue de la Chaussée d'Antin, where it was stopped by a block of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.307#vehicles. Bourras went on, with a vague expression in his eyes, as if he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.308#were dreaming aloud. He still failed to understand the triumph
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.309#achieved by The Ladies' Paradise, but he acknowledged the defeat of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.310#old-fashioned traders.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.311#“Poor Robineau's done for, he's got the face of a drowning man. And the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.312#Bédorés and the Vanpouilles, they can't keep going; they're like me,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.313#played out Deslignières will die of apoplexy. Piot and Rivoire have the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.314#yellow jaundice. Ah! we're a fine lot; a pretty cortege of skeletons to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.315#follow the poor child. It must be comical for those looking on to see
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.316#this string of bankrupts pass. Besides, it appears that the clean sweep
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.317#is to continue. The scoundrels are creating departments for flowers,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.318#bonnets, perfumery, shoemaking, all sorts of things. Grognet, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.319#perfumer in the Rue de Grammont, can clear out, and I wouldn't give ten
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.320#francs for Naud's shoe-shop in the Rue d'Antin. The cholera has spread
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.321#as far as the Rue Sainte-Anne, where Lacassagne, at the feather and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.322#flower shop, and Madame Chadeuil, whose bonnets are so well-known, will
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.323#be swept away before long. And after those, others; it will still go
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.324#on! All the businesses in the neighbourhood will suffer. When
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.325#counter-jumpers commence to sell soap and goloshes, they are quite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.326#capable of dealing in fried potatoes. My word, the world is turning
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.327#upside down!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.328#The hearse was just then crossing the Place de la Trinité to ascend the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.329#steep Rue Blanche, and from the corner of the gloomy coach Denise, who,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.330#broken-hearted, was listening to the endless complaints of the old man,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.331#could see the coffin as they issued from the Rue de la Chaussée d'Antin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.332#Behind her uncle, marching along with the blind, mute face of an ox
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.333#about to be poleaxed, she seemed to hear the tramping of a flock of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.334#sheep led to the slaughter-house, the discomfiture of the shops of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.335#whole district, the small traders dragging along their ruin, with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.336#thud of damp shoes, through the muddy streets of Paris. Bourras still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.337#went on, in a deeper voice, as if slackened by the difficult ascent of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.338#the Rue Blanche.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.339#“As for me, I am settled. But I still hold on all the same, and won't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.340#let go. He's just lost his appeal case. Ah! that's cost me something,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.341#what with nearly two years' pleading, and the solicitors and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.342#barristers! Never mind, he won't pass under my shop, the judges have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.343#decided that such a work could not be considered as a legitimate case
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.344#of repairing. Fancy, he talked of creating underneath a light saloon to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.345#judge the colours of the stuffs by gas-light, a subterranean room which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.346#would have united the hosiery to the drapery department! And he can't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.347#get over it; he can't swallow the fact that an old humbug like me should
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.348#stop his progress when everybody are on their knees before his money.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.349#Never! I won't! that's understood. Very likely I may be worsted. Since I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.350#have had to go to the money-lenders, I know the villain is looking after
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.351#my paper, in the hope to play me some villanous trick, no doubt. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.352#that doesn't matter. He says 'yes,' and I say 'no,' and shall still say
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.353#'no,' even when I get between two boards like this poor little girl who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.354#has just been nailed up.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.355#When they reached the Boulevard de Clichy, the coach went at a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.356#quicker pace; one could hear the heavy breathing of the mourners, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.357#unconscious haste of the cortege, anxious to get the sad ceremony over.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.358#What Bourras did not openly mention, was the frightful misery into which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.359#he had fallen, bewildered amidst the confusion of the small trader who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.360#is on the road to ruin and yet remains obstinate, under a shower of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.361#protested bills. Denise, well acquainted with his situation, at last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.362#interrupted the silence by saying, in a voice of entreaty:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.363#“Monsieur Bourras, pray don't stand out any longer. Let me arrange
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.364#matters for you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.365#But he interrupted her with a violent gesture. “You be quiet. That's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.366#nobody's business. You're a good little girl, and I know you lead him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.367#a hard life, this man who thought you were for sale like my house. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.368#what would you answer if I advised you to say 'yes?' You'd send me about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.369#my business. Therefore, when I say 'no,' don't you interfere in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.370#matter.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.371#And the coach having stopped at the cemetery gate, he got out with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.372#young girl. The Baudus' vault was situated in the first alley on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.373#left. In a few minutes the ceremony was terminated. Jean had drawn
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.374#away his uncle, who was looking into the grave with a gaping air. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.375#mourners wandered about amongst the neighbouring tombs, and the faces
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.376#of all these shopkeepers, their blood impoverished by living in their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.377#unhealthy shops assumed an ugly suffering look under the leaden sky.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.378#When the coffin slipped gently down, their blotched and pimpled cheeks
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.379#paled, and their bleared eyes, blinded with figures, turned away.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.380#“We ought all to jump into this hole,” said Bourras to Denise, who had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.381#kept close to him. “In burying this poor girl they are burying the whole
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.382#district. Oh! I know what I am saying, the old-fashioned business may go
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.383#and join the white roses they are throwing on to her coffin.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.384#Denise brought back her uncle and brother in a mourning coach. The day
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.385#was for her exceedingly dull and melancholy. In the first place, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.386#began to get anxious at Jean's paleness, and when she understood that it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.387#was on account of another woman, she tried to quiet him by opening her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.388#purse, but he shook his head and refused, saying it was serious this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.389#time, the niece of a very rich pastry-cook, who would not accept even
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.390#a bunch of violets. Afterwards, in the afternoon, when Denise went to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.391#fetch Pépé from Madame Gras's, the latter declared that he was getting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.392#too big for her to keep any longer; another annoyance, for she would be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.393#obliged to find him a school, perhaps send him away. And to crown all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.394#she was thoroughly heart-broken, on bringing Pépé back to kiss his aunt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.395#and uncle, to see the gloomy sadness of The Old Elbeuf. The shop was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.396#closed, and the old couple were at the further end of the little room,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.397#where they had forgotten to light the gas, notwithstanding the complete
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.398#obscurity of this winter's day. They were now quite alone, face to face,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.399#in the house, slowly emptied by ruin; and the death of their daughter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.400#deepened the shady corners, and was like the supreme cracking which was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.401#soon to break up the old rafters, eaten away by the damp. Beneath this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.402#destruction, her uncle, unable to stop himself, still kept walking round
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.403#the table, with his funeral-like step, blind and silent; whilst her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.404#aunt said nothing, she had fallen into a chair, with the white face of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.405#wounded person, whose blood was running away drop by drop. They did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.406#even weep when Pépé covered their cold cheeks with kisses. Denise was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.407#choked with tears.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.408#That same evening Mouret sent for the young girl to speak of a child's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.409#garment he wished to launch forth, a mixture of the Scotch and Zouave
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.410#costumes. And still trembling with pity, shocked at so much suffering,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.411#she could not contain herself; she first ventured to speak of Bourras,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.412#of that poor old man whom they were about to ruin. But, on hearing the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.413#umbrella maker's name, Mouret flew into a rage at once. The old madman,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.414#as he called him, was the plague of his life, and spoilt his triumph
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.415#by his idiotic obstinacy in not giving up his house, that ignoble hovel
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.416#which was a disgrace to The Ladies' Paradise, the only little corner
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.417#of the vast block that escaped his conquest. The matter was becoming a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.418#regular nightmare; any one else but Denise speaking in favour of Bourras
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.419#would have run the risk of being dismissed immediately, so violently was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.420#Mouret tortured by the sickly desire to kick the house down. In short,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.421#what did they wish him to do? Could he leave this heap of ruins sticking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.422#to The Ladies' Paradise? It would be got rid of, the shop was to pass
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.423#through it. So touch the worse for the old fool! And he spoke of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.424#repeated proposals; he had offered him as much as a hundred thousand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.425#francs. Wasn't that fair? He never higgled, he gave the money required;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.426#but in return he expected people to be reasonable, and allow him to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.427#finish his work! Did any one ever try to stop the locomotives on a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.428#railway? She listened to him, with drooping eyes, unable to find any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.429#but purely sentimental reasons. The old man was so old, they might have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.430#waited till his death; a failure would kill him. Then he added that he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.431#was no longer able to prevent things going their course. Bourdoncle had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.432#taken the matter up, for the board had resolved to put an end ta it. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.433#had nothing more to add, notwithstanding the grievous pity she felt for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.434#her old friend.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.435#After a painful silence, Mouret himself commenced to speak of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.436#Baudus, by expressing his sorrow at the death of their daughter. They
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.437#were very worthy people, very honest, but had been pursued by the worst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.438#of luck. Then he resumed his arguments; at bottom, they had really
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.439#caused their own misfortune by obstinately sticking to the old ways in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.440#their worm-eaten place; it was not astonishing that the place should be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.441#falling about their heads. He had predicted it scores of times; she must
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.442#remember that he had charged her to warn her uncle of a fatal disaster,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.443#if the latter still clung to his old-fashioned stupid ways. And the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.444#catastrophe had arrived; no one in the world could now prevent it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.445#They could not reasonably expect him to ruin himself to save the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.446#neighbourhood. Besides, if he had been foolish enough to close The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.447#Ladies' Paradise, another big shop would have sprung up of itself next
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.448#door, for the idea was now starting from the four corners of the globe;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.449#the triumph of these manufacturing and industrial cities was sown by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.450#the spirit of the times, which was sweeping away the tumbling edifice
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.451#of former ages. Little by little Mouret warmed up, and found an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.452#eloquent emotion with which to defend himself against the hatred of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.453#involuntary victims, the clamour of the small dying shops that was heard
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.454#around him. They could not keep their dead, he continued, they must bury
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.455#them; and with a gesture he sent down into the grave, swept away and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.456#threw into the common hole the corpse of old-fashioned business, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.457#greenish, poisonous remains of which were becoming a disgrace to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.458#bright, sun-lighted streets of new Paris. No, no, he felt no remorse,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.459#he was simply doing the work of his age, and she knew it; she, who loved
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.460#life, who had a passion for big affairs, concluded in the full glare of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.461#publicity. Reduced to silence, she listened to him for some time, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.462#then went away, her soul full of trouble.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.463#That night Denise slept but little. A sleeplessness, traversed by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.464#nightmare, kept her turning over and over in her bed. It seemed to her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.465#that she was quite little, and she burst into tears, in their garden at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.466#Valognes, on seeing the blackcaps eat up the spiders, which themselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.467#devoured the flies. Was it then really true, this necessity for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.468#world to fatten on death, this struggle for existence which drove
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.469#people into the charnel-house of eternal destruction? Afterwards she saw
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.470#herself before the vault into which they had lowered Geneviève, then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.471#she perceived her uncle and aunt in their obscure dining-room. In
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.472#the profound silence, a heavy voice, as of something tumbling down,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.473#traversed the dead air; it was Bourras's house giving way, as if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.474#undermined by a high tide. The silence recommenced, more sinister than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.475#ever, and a fresh rumbling was heard, then another, then another; the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.476#Robineaus, the Bédorés, the Vanpouilles, cracked and fell down in their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.477#turn, the small shops of the neighbourhood were disappearing beneath an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.478#invisible pick, with a brusque, thundering noise, as of a tumbril being
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.479#emptied. Then an immense pity awoke her with a start. Heavens! what
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.480#tortures! There were families weeping, old men thrown out into the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.481#street, all the poignant dramas that ruin conjures up. And she could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.482#save nobody; and she felt that it was right, that all this misery was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.483#necessary for the health of the Paris of the future. When day broke she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.484#became calmer, a feeling of resigned melancholy kept her awake, turned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.485#towards the windows through which the light was making its way. Yes, it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.486#was the meed of blood that every revolution exacted from its martyrs,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.487#every step forward was made over the bodies of the dead. Her fear
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.488#of being a wicked girl, of having assisted in the ruin of her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.489#fellow-creatures, now melted into a heartfelt pity, in face of these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.490#evils without remedy, which are the painful accompaniment of each
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.491#generation's birth. She finished by seeking some possible comfort in her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.492#goodness, she dreamed of the means to be employed in order to save her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.493#relations at least from the final crash.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.494#Mouret now appeared before her with his passionate face and caressing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.495#eyes. He would certainly refuse her nothing; she felt sure he would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.496#accord her all reasonable compensation. And her thoughts went astray
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.497#in trying to judge him. She knew his life, was aware of the calculating
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.498#nature of his former affections, his continual exploitation of woman,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.499#mistresses taken up to further his own ends, and his intimacy with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.500#Madame Desforges solely to get hold of Baron Hartmann, and all the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.501#others, such as Clara and the rest, pleasure bought, paid for, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.502#thrown out on the pavement. But these beginnings of a love adventurer,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.503#which were the talk of the shop, were gradually effaced by the strokes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.504#of genius of this man, his victorious grace. He was seduction itself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.505#What she could never have forgiven was his former deception, his lover's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.506#coldness under the gallant comedy of his attentions. But she felt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.507#herself to be entirely without rancour, now that he was suffering
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.508#through her. This suffering had elevated him. When she saw him tortured
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.509#by her refusal, atoning so fully for his former disdain for woman, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.510#seemed to have made amends for all his faults.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.511#That morning Denise obtained from Mouret the compensation she might
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.512#judge legitimate the day the Baudus and old Bourras should succumb.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.513#Weeks passed away, during which she went to see her uncle nearly every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.514#afternoon, escaping from her counter for a few minutes, bringing her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.515#smiling face and brave courage to enliven the sombre shop. She was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.516#especially anxious about her aunt, who had fallen into a dull stupor
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.517#since Geneviève's death; it seemed that her life was quitting her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.518#hourly; and when people spoke to her she would reply with an astonished
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.519#air that she was not suffering, but that she simply felt as if overcome
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.520#by sleep. The neighbours shook their heads, saying she would not live
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.521#long to regret her daughter.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.522#One day Denise was coming out of the Baudus', when, on turning the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.523#corner of the Place Oaillon, she heard a loud cry. The crowd rushed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.524#forward, a panic arose, that breath of fear and pity which so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.525#suddenly seizes a crowd. It was a brown omnibus, belonging to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.526#Bastille-Batignolles line, which had run over a man, coming out of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.527#Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin, opposite the fountain. Upright on his seat,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.528#with furious gestures, the driver was pulling in his two kicking horses,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.529#and crying out, in a great passion:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.530#“Confound you! Why don't you look out, you idiot!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.531#The omnibus had now stopped, and the crowd had surrounded the wounded
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.532#man, and, strange to say, a policeman was soon on the spot. Still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.533#standing up, invoking the testimony of the people on the knife-board,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.534#who had also got up, to look over and see the wounded man, the coachman
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.535#was explaining the matter, with exasperated gestures, choked by his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.536#increasing anger.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.537#“It's something fearful. This fellow was walking in the middle of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.538#road, quite at home. I called out, and he at once threw himself under
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.539#the wheels!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.540#A house-painter, who had run up, brush in hand, from a neighbouring
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.541#house, then said, in a sharp voice, amidst the clamour: “Don't excite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.542#yourself. I saw him, he threw himself under. He jumped in, head first.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.543#Another unfortunate tired of life, no doubt.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.544#Others spoke up, and all agreed upon it being a case of suicide, whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.545#the policeman pulled out his book and made his entry. Several ladies,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.546#very pale, got out quickly, and ran away without looking back, filled
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.547#with horror by the soft shaking which had stirred them up when the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.548#omnibus passed over the body. Denise approached, attracted by a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.549#practical pity, which prompted her to interest herself in all sorts
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.550#of street accidents, wounded dogs, horses down, and tilers falling off
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.551#roofs. And she immediately recognised the unfortunate fellow who had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.552#fainted away, his clothes covered with mud.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.553#“It's Monsieur Robineau,” cried she, in her grievous astonishment.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.554#The policeman at once questioned the young girl, and she gave his name,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.555#profession, and address. Thanks to the driver's energy, the omnibus had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.556#twisted round, and thus only Robineau's legs had gone under the wheels,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.557#but it was to be feared that they were both broken. Four men carried
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.558#the wounded draper to a chemist's shop in the Rue Gaillon, whilst the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.559#omnibus slowly resumed its journey.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.560#“My stars!” said the driver, whipping up his horses, “I've done a famous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.561#day's work.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.562#Denise followed Robineau into the chemist's. The latter, waiting for a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.563#doctor who could not be found, declared there was no immediate danger,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.564#and that the wounded man had better be taken home, as he lived in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.565#the neighbourhood. A lad started off to the police-station to order a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.566#stretcher, and Denise had the happy thought of going on in front and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.567#preparing Madame Robineau for this frightful blow. But she had the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.568#greatest trouble in the world to get into the street through the crowd,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.569#which was struggling before the door. This crowd, attracted by death,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.570#was increasing every minute; men, women, and children stood on tip-toe,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.571#and held their own amidst a brutal pushing, and each new comer had his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.572#version of the accident, so that at last it was said to be a husband
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.573#pitched out of the window by his wife's lover.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.574#In the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs, Denise perceived Madame Robineau
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.575#on the threshold of the silk warehouse. This gave her a pretext for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.576#stopping, and she talked on for a moment, trying to find a way of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.577#breaking the terrible news. The shop presented the disorderly, abandoned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.578#appearance of the last struggles of a dying business. It was the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.579#inevitable end of the great battle of the silks; the Paris Paradise had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.580#crushed its rival by a fresh reduction of a sou; it was now sold at four
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.581#francs nineteen sous, Gaujean's silk had found its Waterloo. For the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.582#last two months Robineau, reduced to all sorts of shifts, had been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.583#leading a fearful life, trying to prevent a declaration of bankruptcy.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.584#“I've just seen your husband pass through the Place Gaillon,” murmured
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.585#Denise, who had now entered the shop.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.586#Madame Robineau, whom a secret anxiety seemed to be continually
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.587#attracting towards the street, said quickly: “Ah, just now, wasn't it?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.588#I'm waiting for him, he ought to be back; Monsieur Gaujean came up this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.589#morning, and they have gone out together.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.590#She was still charming, delicate, and gay; but her advanced state of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.591#pregnancy gave her a fatigued look, and she was more frightened, more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.592#bewildered than ever, by these business matters, which she did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.593#understand, and which were all going wrong. As she often said, what was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.594#the use of it all? Would it not be better to live quietly in some small
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.595#house, and be contented with modest fare?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.596#“My dear child,” resumed she with her smile, which was becoming sadder,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.597#“we have nothing to conceal from you. Things are not going on well,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.598#and my poor darling is worried to death. To-day this Gaujean has been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.599#tormenting him about some bills overdue. I was dying with anxiety at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.600#being left here all alone.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.601#And she was returning to the door when Denise stopped her, having heard
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.602#the noise of the crowd and guessing that it was the wounded man being
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.603#brought along, surrounded by a mob of idlers anxious to see the end of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.604#the affair. Then, with a parched throat, unable to find the consoling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.605#words she would have wished, she had to explain the matter.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.606#“Don't be anxious, there's no immediate danger. I've seen Monsieur
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.607#Robineau, he has met with an accident. They are just bringing him home,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.608#pray don't be frightened.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.609#The poor woman listened to her, white as a sheet, without clearly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.610#understanding. The street was full of people, the drivers of the impeded
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.611#cabs were swearing, the men had laid down the stretcher before the shop
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.612#in order to open both glass doors.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.613#“It was an accident,” continued Denise, resolved to conceal the attempt
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.614#at suicide. “He was on the pavement and slipped under the wheels of an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.615#omnibus. Only his feet were hurt. They've sent for a doctor. There's no
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.616#need to be anxious.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.617#A shudder passed over Madame Robineau. She set up an inarticulate cry,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.618#then ceased talking and ran to the stretcher, drawing the covering away
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.619#with her trembling hands. The men who had brought Robineau were waiting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.620#to take him away as soon as the doctor arrived. They dared not touch
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.621#him, who had come round again, and whose sufferings were frightful at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.622#the slightest movement. When he saw his wife his eyes filled with tears.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.623#She embraced him, and stood looking fixedly at him, and weeping. In the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.624#street the tumult was increasing; the people pressed forward as at a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.625#theatre, with glistening eyes; some work-girls, escaped from a shop,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.626#were almost pushing through the windows eager to see what was going on.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.627#In order to avoid this feverish curiosity, and thinking, besides, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.628#it was not right to leave the shop open, Denise decided on letting the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.629#metallic shutters down. She went and turned the winch, the wheels of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.630#which gave out a plaintive cry, the sheets of iron slowly descended, like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.631#the heavy draperies of a curtain falling on the catastrophe of a fifth
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.632#act. When she went in again, after closing the little round door in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.633#shutters, she found Madame Robineau still clasping her husband in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.634#her arms, in the half-light which came from the two stars cut in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.635#shutters. The ruined shop seemed to be gliding into nothingness, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.636#two stars alone glittered on this sudden and brutal catastrophe of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.637#streets of Paris.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.638#At last Madame Robineau recovered her speech. “Oh, my darling!--oh, my
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.639#darling! my darling!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.640#This was all she could say, and he, suffocated, confessed himself with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.641#cry of remorse when he saw her kneeling thus before him. When he did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.642#move he only felt the burning lead of his legs.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.643#“Forgive me, I must have been mad. When the lawyer told me before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.644#Gaujean that the posters would be put up tomorrow, I saw flames dancing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.645#before me as if the walls were burning. After that I remember nothing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.646#else. I came down the Rue de la Michodière--it seemed that The Paradise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.647#people were laughing at me, that immense house seemed to crush me.. So,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.648#when the omnibus came up, I thought of Lhomme and his arm, and threw
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.649#myself underneath the omnibus.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.650#Madame Robineau had slowly fallen on to the floor, horrified by this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.651#confession. Heavens! he had tried to kill himself. She seized the hand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.652#of her young friend, who leant over towards her quite overcome. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.653#wounded man, exhausted by emotion, had just fainted away again; and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.654#doctor not having arrived, two men went all over the neighbourhood for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.655#him. The doorkeeper belonging to the house had gone off in his turn to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.656#look for him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.657#“Pray, don't be anxious,” repeated Denise, mechanically, herself also
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.658#sobbing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.659#Then Madame Robineau, seated on the floor, with her head against the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.660#stretcher, her cheek placed on the mattress where her husband was lying,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.661#relieved her heart “Oh! I must tell you. It's all for me he wanted to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.662#die. He's always saying, 'I've robbed you; it was not my money.' And at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.663#night he dreams of this money, waking up covered with perspiration,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.664#calling himself an incapable fellow, saying that those who have no head
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.665#for business ought not to risk other people's money. You know he has
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.666#always been nervous, his brain tormented. He finished by conjuring up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.667#things that frightened me. He saw me in the street in tatters, begging,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.668#his darling wife, whom he loved so tenderly, whom he longed to see rich
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.669#and happy.” But on turning round, she noticed he had opened his eyes;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.670#and she continued in a trembling voice: “My darling, why have you done
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.671#this? You must think me very wicked! I assure you, I don't care if we
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.672#are ruined. So long as we are together, we shall never be unhappy. Let
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.673#them take everything, and we will go away somewhere, where you won't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.674#hear any more about them. You can still work; you'll see how happy we
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.675#shall be!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.676#She placed her forehead near her husband's pale face, and both were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.677#silent, in the emotion of their anguish. There was a pause. The shop
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.678#seemed to be sleeping, benumbed by the pale night which enveloped it;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.679#whilst behind the thin shutters could be heard the noises of the street,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.680#the life of the busy city, the rumble of the vehicles, and the hustling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.681#and pushing of the passing crowd. At last Denise, who went every minute
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.682#to glance through the hall door, came back, exclaiming: “Here's the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.683#doctor!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.684#He was a young fellow, with bright eyes, whom the doorkeeper had found
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.685#and brought in. He preferred to examine the poor man before they put him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.686#to bed. Only one of his legs, the left one, was broken above the ankle;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.687#it was a simple fracture, no serious complication appeared likely to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.688#result from it. And they were about to carry the stretcher into the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.689#back-room when Gaujean arrived. He came to give them an account of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.690#a last attempt to settle matters, an attempt which had failed; the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.691#declaration of bankruptcy was definite.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.692#“Dear me,” murmured he, “what's the matter?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.693#In a few words, Denise informed him. Then he stopped, feeling rather
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.694#awkward, while Robineau said, in a feeble voice: “I don't bear you any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.695#ill-will, but all this is partly your fault.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.696#“Well, my dear fellow,” replied Gaujean, “it wanted stronger men than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.697#us. You know I'm not in a much better state than you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.698#They raised the stretcher; Robineau still found strength to say: “No,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.699#no, stronger fellows than us would have given way as we have. I can
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.700#understand such obstinate old men as Bourras and Baudu standing out, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.701#you and I, who are young, who had accepted the new style of tilings! No,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.702#Gaujean, it's the last of a world.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.703#They carried him off. Madame Robineau embraced Denise with an eagerness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.704#in which there was almost a feeling of joy, to have at last got rid of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.705#all those worrying business matters. And, as Gaujean went away with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.706#young girl, he confessed to her that this poor devil of a Robineau was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.707#right. It was idiotic to try and struggle against The Ladies' Paradise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.708#He personally felt himself lost, if he did not give in. Last night, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.709#fact, he had secretly made a proposal to Hutin, who was just leaving for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.710#Lyons. But he felt very doubtful, and tried to interest Denise in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.711#matter, aware, no doubt, of her powerfulness.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.712#“My word,” said he, “so much the worse for the manufacturers! Every
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.713#one would laugh at me if I ruined myself in fighting for other people's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.714#benefit, when these fellows are struggling who shall make at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.715#cheapest price! As you said some time ago, the manufacturers have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.716#only to follow the march of progress by a better organisation and new
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.717#methods. Everything will come all right; it suffices that the public are
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.718#satisfied.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.719#Denise smiled and replied: “Go and say that to Monsieur Mouret himself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.720#Your visit will please him, and he's not the man to display any rancour,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.721#if you offer him even a centime profit per yard.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.722#Madame Baudu died in January, on a bright sunny afternoon. For some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.723#weeks she had been unable to go down into the shop that a charwoman now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.724#looked after. She was in bed, propped up by the pillows. Nothing but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.725#her eyes seemed to be living in her white face, and, her head erect, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.726#kept them obstinately fixed on The Ladies' Paradise opposite, through
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.727#the small curtains of the windows. Baudu, himself suffering from this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.728#obsession, from the despairing fixity of her gaze, sometimes wanted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.729#to draw the large curtains to. But she stopped him with an imploring
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.730#gesture, obstinately desirous of seeing the monster shop till the last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.731#moment. It had now robbed her of everything, her business, her daughter;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.732#she herself had gradually died away with The Old Elbeuf, losing a part
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.733#of her life as the shop lost its customers; the day it succumbed, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.734#had no more breath left When she felt she was dying, she still found the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.735#strength to insist on her husband opening the two windows. It was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.736#very mild, a bright day of sun gilded The Ladies' Paradise, whilst the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.737#bed-room of their old house shivered in the shade. Madame Baudu lay with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.738#her fixed gaze, absorbed by the vision of the triumphal monument, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.739#clear, limpid windows, behind which a gallop of millions was passing.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.740#Slowly her eyes grew dim, invaded by darkness; and when they at last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.741#sunk in death, they remained wide open, still looking, drowned in tears.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.742#Once more the ruined traders of the district followed the funeral
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.743#procession. There were the brothers Vanpouille, pale at the thought of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.744#their December bills, paid by a supreme effort which they would never be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.745#able to repeat. Bédoré, with his sister, leant on his cane, so full of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.746#worry and anxiety that his liver complaint was getting worse every day.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.747#Deslignières had had a fit, Piot and Rivoire walked on in silence, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.748#downcast looks, like men entirely played out. They dared not question
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.749#each other about those who had disappeared, Quinette, Mademoiselle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.750#Tatin, and others, who were sinking, ruined, swept away by this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.751#disastrous flood; without counting Robineau, still in bed, with his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.752#broken leg. But they pointed with an especial air of interest to the new
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.753#tradesmen attacked by the plague; the perfumer Grognet, the milliner
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.754#Madame Chadeuil, Lacassagne, the flower maker, and Naud, the bootmaker,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.755#still standing firm, but seized by the anxiety of the evil, which would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.756#doubtless sweep them away in their turn. Baudu walked along behind the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.757#hearse with the same heavy, stolid step as when he had followed his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.758#daughter; whilst at the back of a mourning coach could be seen Bourras's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.759#sparkling eyes under his bushy eyebrows, and his hair of a snowy white.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.760#Denise was in great trouble. For the last fifteen days she had been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.761#worn out with fatigue and anxiety; she had been obliged to put Pépé to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.762#school, and had been running about for Jean, who was so stricken with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.763#the pastrycook's niece, that he had implored his sister to go and ask
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.764#her hand in marriage. Then her aunt's death, these repeated catastrophes
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.765#had quite overwhelmed the young girl. Mouret again offered his services,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.766#giving her leave to do what she liked for her uncle and the others.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.767#One morning she had an interview with him, at the news that Bourras was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.768#turned into the street, and that Baudu was going to shut up shop. Then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.769#she went out after breakfast in the hope of comforting these two, at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.770#least.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.771#In the Rue de la Michodière, Bourras was standing on the pavement
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.772#opposite his house, from which he had been expelled the previous day by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.773#a fine trick, a discovery of the lawyers; as Mouret held some bills, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.774#had easily obtained an order in bankruptcy against the umbrella-maker;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.775#then he had given five hundred francs for the expiring lease at the sale
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.776#ordered by the court; so that the obstinate old man had allowed himself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.777#to be deprived of, for five hundred francs, what he had refused to give
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.778#up for a hundred thousand. The architect, who came with his gang of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.779#workmen, had been obliged to employ the police to get him out. The goods
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.780#had been taken and sold; but he still kept himself obstinately in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.781#corner where he slept, and from which they did not like to drive him,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.782#out of pity. The workmen even attacked the roofing over his head.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.783#They had taken off the rotten slates, the ceilings fell in, the walls
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.784#cracked, and yet he stuck there, under the naked old beams, amidst the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.785#ruins of the shop. At last the police came, and he went away. But the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.786#following morning he again appeared on the opposite side of the street,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.787#after having spent the night in a lodging-house in the neighbourhood.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.788#“Monsieur Bourras!” said Denise, kindly.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.789#He did not hear her, his flaming eyes were devouring the workmen who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.790#were attacking the front of the hovel with their picks. Through the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.791#empty window-frames could be seen the inside of the house, the miserable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.792#rooms, and the black staircase, where the sun had not penetrated for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.793#last two hundred years. .
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.794#“Ah! it's you,” replied he, at last, when he recognised her. “A nice bit
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.795#of work they're doing, eh? the robbers!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.796#She did not now dare to speak, stirred up by the lamentable sadness of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.797#the old place, herself unable to take her eyes off the mouldy stones
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.798#that were falling. Above, in a corner of the ceiling of her old room, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.799#still perceived the name in black and shaky letters--Ernestine--written
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.800#with the flame of a candle, and the remembrance of those days of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.801#misery came back to her, inspiring her with a tender sympathy for all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.802#suffering. But the workmen, in order to knock one of the walls down at a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.803#blow, had attacked it at its base. It was tottering.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.804#“Should like to see it crush all of them,” growled Bourras, in a savage
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.805#voice.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.806#There was a terrible cracking noise. The frightened workmen ran out into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.807#the street. In falling down, the wall tottered and carried all the house
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.808#with it. No doubt the hovel was ripe for the fall--it could no longer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.809#stand, with its flaws and cracks; a push had sufficed to cleave it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.810#from top to bottom. It was a pitiful crumbling away, the razing of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.811#mud-house soddened by the rains. Not a board remained standing; there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.812#was nothing on the ground but a heap of rubbish, the dung of the past
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.813#thrown at the street corner.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.814#“Oh, heavens!” exclaimed the old man, as if the blow had resounded in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.815#his very entrails.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.816#He stood there gaping, never supposing it would have been over so quick.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.817#And he looked at the gap, the hollow space at last left free on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.818#flanks of The Ladies' Paradise. It was like the crushing of a gnat, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.819#final triumph over the annoying obstinacy of the infinitely small, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.820#whole isle invaded and conquered. The passers-by lingered to talk to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.821#workmen, who were crying out against these old buildings, only good for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.822#killing people.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.823#“Monsieur Bourras,” repeated Denise, trying to get him on one side, “you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.824#know that you will not be abandoned. All your wants will be provided
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.825#for.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.826#He held up his head. “I have no wants. You've been sent by them, haven't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.827#you? Well, tell them that old Bourras still knows how to work, and that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.828#he can find work wherever he likes. Really, it would be a fine thing to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.829#offer charity to those they are assassinating!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.830#Then she implored him: “Pray accept, Monsieur Bourras; don't give me
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.831#this grief.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.832#But he shook his bushy head. “No, no, it's all over. Good-bye. Go and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.833#live happily, you who are young, and don't prevent old people sticking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.834#to their ideas.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.835#He cast a last glance at the heap of rubbish, and then went away. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.836#watched him disappear, elbowed by the crowd on the pavement. He turned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.837#the corner of the Place Gaillon, and all was over. For a moment, Denise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.838#remained motionless, lost in thought. At last she went over to her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.839#uncle's. The draper was alone in the dark shop of The Old Elbeuf. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.840#charwoman only came morning and evening to do a little cooking, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.841#to take down and put up the shutters. He spent hours in this solitude,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.842#often without being disturbed once during the whole day, bewildered, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.843#unable to find the goods when a stray customer happened to venture in.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.844#And there in the half-light he marched about unceasingly, with that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.845#heavy step he had at the two funerals, yielding to a sickly desire,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.846#regular fits of forced marching, as if he were trying to rock his grief
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.847#to sleep.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.848#“Are you feeling better, uncle?” asked Denise. He only stopped for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.849#a second to glance at her. Then he started off again, going from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.850#pay-desk to an obscure corner.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.851#“Yes, yes. Very well, thanks.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.852#She tried to find some consoling subject, some cheerful remark, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.853#could think of nothing. “Did you hear the noise? The house is down.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.854#“Ah! it's true,” murmured he, with an astonished look, “that must have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.855#been the house. I felt the ground tremble. Seeing them on the roof this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.856#morning, I closed my door.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.857#And he made a vague movement, to imitate that such things no longer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.858#interested him. Every time he arrived before the pay-desk, he looked at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.859#the empty seat, that well-known velvet-covered seat, where his wife and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.860#daughter had grown up. Then when his perpetual walking brought him to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.861#the other end, he gazed at the shelves drowned in shadow, in which a few
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.862#pieces of cloth were gradually growing mouldy. It was a widowed house,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.863#those he loved had disappeared, his business had come to a shameful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.864#end, and he was left alone to commune with his dead heart, and his pride
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.865#brought low amidst all these catastrophes. He raised his eyes towards
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.866#the black ceiling, overcome by the sepulchral silence which reigned in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.867#the little dining-room, the family nook, of which he had formerly loved
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.868#every part, even down to the stuffy odour. Not a breath was now heard in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.869#the old house, his regular heavy step made the ancient walls resound, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.870#if he were walking over the tombs of his affections.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.871#At last Denise approached the subject which had brought her. “Uncle, you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.872#can't stay like this. You must come to a decision.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.873#He replied, without stopping his walk--“No doubt; but what would you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.874#have me do? I've tried to sell, but no one has come. One of these
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.875#mornings I shall shut up shop and go off.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.876#She was aware that a failure was no longer to be feared. The creditors
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.877#had preferred to come to an understanding before such a long series
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.878#of misfortunes. Everything paid, the old man would find himself in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.879#street, penniless.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.880#“But what will you do, then?” murmured she, seeking some transition in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.881#order to arrive at the offer she dared not make.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.882#“I don't know,” replied he. “They'll pick me up all right.” He had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.883#changed his route, going from the dining-room to the windows with their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.884#lamentable displays, looking at the latter, every time he came to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.885#them, with a gloomy expression. His gaze did not even turn towards the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.886#triumphal façade of The Ladies' Paradise, whose architectural lines ran
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.887#as far as the eye could see, to the right and to the left, at both
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.888#ends of the street. He was thoroughly annihilated, and had not even the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.889#strength to get angry.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.890#“Listen, uncle,” said Denise, greatly embarrassed; “perhaps there might
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.891#be a situation for you.” She stopped, and stammered. “Yes, I am charged
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.892#to offer you a situation as inspector.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.893#“Where?” asked Baudu.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.894#“Opposite,” replied she; “in our shop. Six thousand francs a year; a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.895#very easy place.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.896#Suddenly he stopped in front of her. But instead of getting angry as she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.897#feared he would, he turned very pale, succumbing to a grievous emotion,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.898#a feeling of bitter resignation.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.899#“Opposite, opposite,” stammered he several times. “You want me to go
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.900#opposite?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.901#Denise herself was affected by this emotion. She recalled the long
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.902#struggle of the two shops, assisted at the funerals of Geneviève and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.903#Madame Baudu, saw before her The Old Elbeuf overthrown, utterly ruined
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.904#by The Ladies' Paradise. And the idea of her uncle taking a situation
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.905#opposite, and walking about in a white neck-tie, made her heart leap
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.906#with pity and revolt.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.907#“Come, Denise, is it possible?” said he, simply, wringing his poor
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.908#trembling hands.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.909#“No, no, uncle,” exclaimed she, in a sudden burst of her just and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.910#excellent being. “It would be wrong. Forgive me, I beg of you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.911#He resumed his walk, his step once more broke the funereal silence
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.912#of the house. And when she left him, he was still going on in that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.913#obstinate locomotion of great griefs, which turn round themselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.914#without ever being able to get beyond.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.915#Denise passed another sleepless night. She had just touched the bottom
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.916#of her powerlessness. Even in favour of her own people she was unable to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.917#find any consolation. She had been obliged to assist to the bitter end
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.918#at this invincible work of life which requires death as its continual
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.919#seed. She no longer struggled, she accepted this law of combat; but her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.920#womanly soul was filled with a weeping pity, with a fraternal tenderness
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.921#at the idea of suffering humanity. For years, she herself had been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.922#caught in the wheel-work of the machine. Had she not bled there? Had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.923#they not bruised her, dismissed her, overwhelmed her with insults? Even
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.924#now she was frightened, when she felt herself chosen by the logic of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.925#facts. Why her, a girl so puny? Why should her small hand suddenly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.926#become so powerful amidst the monster's work? And the force which was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.927#sweeping everything away, carried her away in her turn, she, whose
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.928#coming was to be a revenge. Mouret had invented this mechanism for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.929#crushing the world, and its brutal working shocked her; he had sown ruin
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.930#all over the neighbourhood, despoiled some, killed others; and yet she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.931#loved him for the grandeur of his work, she loved him still more at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.932#every excess of his power, notwithstanding the flood of tears which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiii.933#overcame her, before the sacred misery of the vanquished.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1#CHAPTER XIV.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.2#The Rue du Dix-Décembre, looking quite new with its chalk-white houses
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.3#and the final scaffoldings of some nearly finished buildings, stretched
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.4#out beneath a clear February sun; a stream of carriages was passing at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.5#a rattling pace through this gleam of light, which traversed the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.6#damp shadow of the old Saint-Roch quarter; and, between the Rue de
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.7#la Michodière and the Rue de Choiseul, there was a great tumult, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.8#crushing of a crowd excited by a month's advertising, their eyes in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.9#the air, gaping at the monumental façade of The Ladies' Paradise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.10#inaugurated that Monday, on the occasion of a grand show of white goods.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.11#The bright new masonry displayed a vast development of polychromatic
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.12#architecture, relieved by gildings, announcing the tumult and sparkle
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.13#of the business inside, and attracting attention like a gigantic
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.14#window-display all aglow with the liveliest colours. In order not to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.15#neutralise the show of goods, the decoration of the ground floor was of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.16#a sober description; the base of sea-green marble; the corner pillars
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.17#and the supporting columns were covered with black marble, the severity
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.18#of which was relieved by gilded medallions; and the rest of plate-glass,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.19#in iron sashes, nothing but glass, which seemed to open up the depths
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.20#of the halls and galleries to the full light of day. But as the floors
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.21#ascended, the tones became brighter. The frieze on the ground floor was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.22#decorated with a series of mosaics, a garland of red and blue flowers,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.23#alternating with marble slabs, on which were cut the names of goods,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.24#running all round, encircling the colossus. Then the base of the first
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.25#floor, made of enamelled bricks, supported the large windows, as high as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.26#the frieze, formed of gilded escutcheons, with the arms of the towns of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.27#France, and designs in terra-cotta, the enamel of which reproduced
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.28#the bright coloured flowers of the base. Then, right at the top, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.29#entablature blossomed forth like the ardent florescence of the entire
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.30#façade, the mosaics and the faience reappeared with warmer colourings,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.31#the zinc gutters were carved and gilded, while along the acroteria ran
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.32#a nation of statues, representing the great industrial and manufacturing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.33#cities, their delicate silhouettes standing out against the sky. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.34#spectators were especially astonished at the sight of the central door,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.35#also decorated with a profusion of mosaics, faience, and terra-cotta,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.36#and surmounted by an allegorical group, the new gilding of which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.37#glittered in the sun: Woman dressed and kissed by a flight of laughing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.38#cupids.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.39#About two o'clock the police were obliged to make the crowd move on, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.40#to look after the carriages. The palace was built, the temple raised to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.41#the extravagant folly of fashion. It dominated everything, covering
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.42#a whole district with its shadow. The scar left on its flank by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.43#demolition of Bourras's hovel had already been so skilfully cicatrised
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.44#that it would have been impossible to find the place formerly occupied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.45#by this old wart--the four façades now ran along the four streets,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.46#without a break in their superb isolation. Since Baudu's retirement, The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.47#Old Elbeuf, on the other side of the way, had been closed, walled up like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.48#a tomb, behind the shutters that were never now taken down; little by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.49#little the cab-wheels had splashed them, posters covered them up and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.50#pasted them together, a rising tide of advertising, which seemed like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.51#the last shovelful of earth thrown over the old-fashioned commerce; and,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.52#in the middle of this dead frontage, dirtied by the mud from the street,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.53#discoloured by the refuse of Paris, was displayed, like a flag planted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.54#over a conquered empire, an immense yellow poster, quite wet, announcing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.55#in letters two feet high the great sale at The Ladies' Paradise. It
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.56#was as if the colossus, after each enlargement, seized with shame and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.57#repugnance for the black old quarter, where it had modestly sprung up,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.58#and that it had later on slaughtered, had just turned its back to it,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.59#leaving the mud of the narrow streets in its track, presenting its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.60#upstart face to the noisy, sunny thoroughfare of new Paris.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.61#As it was now represented in the engraving of the advertisements, it had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.62#grown bigger and bigger, like the ogre of the legend, whose shoulders
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.63#threatened to pierce the clouds. In the first place, in the foreground
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.64#of the engraving, were the Rue du Dix-Décembre, the Rue de la
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.65#Michodière, and the Rue de Choiseul, filled with little black figures,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.66#and spread out immoderately, as if to make room for the customers of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.67#whole world. Then came a bird's eye view of the buildings themselves,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.68#of an exaggerated immensity, with their roofings which described the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.69#covered galleries, the glazed courtyards in which could be recognised
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.70#the halls, the endless detail of this lake of glass and zinc shining in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.71#the sun. Beyond, stretched forth Paris, but Paris diminished, eaten
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.72#up by the monster: the houses, of a cottage-like humility in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.73#neighbourhood of the building, then dying away in a cloud of indistinct
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.74#chimneys; the monuments seemed to melt into nothing, to the left
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.75#two dashes for Notre-Dame, to the right a circumflex accent for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.76#Invalides, in the background the Pantheon, ashamed and lost, no larger
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.77#than a lentil. The horizon, crumbled into powder, became no more than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.78#a contemptible frame-work, as far as the heights of Châtillon, out
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.79#into the open country, the vanishing expanse of which indicated how far
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.80#reached the state of slavery.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.81#Ever since the morning the crowd had been increasing. No shop had ever
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.82#yet stirred up the city with such a profusion of advertisements. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.83#Ladies' Paradise now spent nearly six hundred thousand francs a year
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.84#in posters, advertisements, and appeals of all sorts; the number of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.85#catalogues sent away amounted to four hundred thousand, more than a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.86#hundred thousand francs' worth of stuff was cut up for patterns. It was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.87#a complete invasion of the newspapers, the walls, and the ears of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.88#public, like a monstrous brass trumpet, which, blown incessantly, spread
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.89#to the four corners of the earth the tumult of the great sales. And, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.90#the future, this façade, before which people were now crowding, became
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.91#a living advertisement, with its bespangled, gilded magnificence, its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.92#windows large enough to display the entire poem of woman's clothing, its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.93#profusion of signs, painted, engraved, and cut in stone, from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.94#marble slabs on the ground floor to the sheets of iron rounded off in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.95#semicircles above the roof, unfolding their gilded streamers on which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.96#the name of the house could be read in letters bright as the sun,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.97#standing out against the azure blue of the sky.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.98#To celebrate the inauguration, there had been added trophies and flags;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.99#each storey was gay with banners and standards bearing the arms of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.100#the principal cities of France; and right at the top, the flags of all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.101#nations, run up on masts, fluttered in the air, while the show of cotton
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.102#and linen goods downstairs assumed in the windows a tone of blinding
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.103#intensity. Nothing but white, a complete trousseau, and a mountain of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.104#sheets to the left, a lot of curtains forming a chapel, and pyramids
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.105#of handkerchiefs to the right, fatigued the eyes; and, between the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.106#hung goods at the door, whole pieces of cotton, calico, and muslin in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.107#clusters, like snow-drifts, were planted some dressed engravings, sheets
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.108#of bluish cardboard, on which a young bride, or a lady in ball costume,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.109#both life size and dressed in real lace and silk, smiled with their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.110#painted faces. A circle of idlers was constantly forming, a desire arose
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.111#from the admiration of the crowd.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.112#What caused an increase of curiosity around The Ladies' Paradise was a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.113#catastrophe of which all Paris was talking, the burning down of The Four
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.114#Seasons, the big shop Bouthemont had opened near the Opera-house, hardly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.115#three weeks before. The newspapers were full of details, of the fire
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.116#breaking out through an explosion of gas during the night, the hurried
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.117#flight of the young ladies in their night-dresses, and the heroic
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.118#conduct of Bouthemont, who had carried five of them out on his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.119#shoulders. The enormous losses were covered, and the people commenced to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.120#shrug their shoulders, saying what a splendid advertisement it was.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.121#But for the moment attention again flowed back to The Ladies' Paradise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.122#excited by all these stories flying about, occupied to a wonderful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.123#extent by these colossal establishments, which by their importance took
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.124#up such a large place in public life. Wonderfully lucky, this Mouret!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.125#Paris saluted her star, and crowded to see him still standing, since
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.126#the very flames now undertook to sweep all competition from beneath
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.127#his feet; and the profits of the season were already being calculated,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.128#people began to estimate the swollen flood of customers which would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.129#be sent into his shop by the forced closing of the rival house. For a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.130#moment he had felt anxious, troubled at feeling a jealous woman against
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.131#him, that Madame Desforges, to whom he owed in a manner his fortune.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.132#Baron Hartmann's financial dilettantism, putting money into the two
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.133#affairs, annoyed him also. Then he was exasperated at having missed a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.134#genial idea which had occurred to Bouthemont, who had artfully had his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.135#shop blessed by the vicar of the Madeleine, followed by all his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.136#clergy; an astonishing ceremony, a religious pomp paraded from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.137#silk department to the glove department, and so on throughout the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.138#establishment. This imposing ceremony had not, it is true, prevented
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.139#everything being destroyed, but had done as much good as a million
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.140#francs' worth of advertisements, so great an impression had it produced
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.141#on the fashionable world. From that day, Mouret dreamed of having the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.142#archbishop.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.143#The clock over the door was striking three, and the afternoon crush had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.144#commenced, nearly a hundred thousand customers were struggling in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.145#various galleries and halls. Outside, the carriages were stationed from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.146#one end of the Rue du Dix-Décembre to the other, and over against the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.147#Opera-house another compact mass occupied the _cul-de-sac_, where the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.148#future avenue was to commence. Common cabs were mingled with private
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.149#broughams, the drivers waiting amongst the wheels, the rows of horses
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.150#neighing and shaking their bits, which sparkled in the sun. The lines
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.151#were incessantly reformed, amidst the calls of the messengers, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.152#poshing of the animals which closed in of their own accord, whilst fresh
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.153#vehicles were continually arriving and taking their places with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.154#rest. The pedestrians flew on to the refuges in frightened bands, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.155#pavements were black with people, in the receding perspective of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.156#wide and straight thoroughfare. And a clamour arose from between
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.157#the white houses, this human stream rolled along under the soul of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.158#overflowing Paris, a sweet and enormous breath, of which one could feel
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.159#the giant caress.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.160#Madame de Boves, accompanied by her daughter Blanche and Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.161#Guibal, was standing, at a window, looking at a display of half made up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.162#costumes.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.163#“Oh! do look,” said she, “at those print costumes at nineteen francs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.164#fifteen sous!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.165#In their square boxes, the costumes, tied round with a favour, were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.166#folded so as to present the trimmings alone, embroidered with blue and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.167#red; and, occupying the corner of each box, was an engraving showing the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.168#garment made up, worn by a young person looking like some princess.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.169#“But they are not worth more,” murmured Madame Guibal. “They fall into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.170#rags as soon as you handle them.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.171#They had now become intimate since Monsieur de Boves had been confined
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.172#to his arm-chair by an attack of gout. The wife put up with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.173#mistress, preferring that things should take place in her own house, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.174#in this way she picked up a little pocket money, sums that the husband
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.175#allowed himself to be robbed of, having, himself, need of forbearance.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.176#“Well! let's go in,” resumed Madame Guibal “We must see their show.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.177#Hasn't your son-in-law made an appointment with you inside?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.178#Madame de Boves did not reply, entirely absorbed by the string of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.179#carriages, which, one by one, opened their doors and let out more
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.180#customers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.181#“Yes,” said Blanche, at last, in her indolent voice. “Paul is to join us
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.182#about four o'clock in the reading-room, on leaving the ministry.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.183#They had been married about a month, and De Vallagnosc, after a leave of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.184#absence of three weeks, spent in the South of France, had just returned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.185#to his post. The young woman had already her mother's portly look, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.186#her flesh appeared puffed up and coarser since her marriage.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.187#“But there's Madame Desforges over there!” exclaimed the countess,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.188#looking at a brougham that had just arrived.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.189#“Do you think so?” murmured Madame Guibal. “After all those stories! She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.190#must still be weeping over the fire at The Four Seasons.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.191#It was really Henriette. On perceiving her friends, she came up with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.192#gay, smiling air, concealing her defeat beneath the fashionable ease of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.193#her manner.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.194#“Dear me! yes, I wanted to have a look round. It's better to see for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.195#one's self, isn't it? Oh! we are still good friends with Monsieur
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.196#Mouret, though he is said to be furious since I have interested myself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.197#in that rival house. Personally, there is only one thing I cannot
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.198#forgive him, and that is, to have pushed on the marriage of my protege,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.199#Mademoiselle de Fontenailles, with that Joseph----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.200#“What! it's done?” interrupted Madame de Boves. “What a horror!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.201#“Yes, my dear, and solely to annoy us. I know him; he wished to intimate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.202#that the daughters of our great families are only fit to marry his shop
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.203#messengers.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.204#She was getting quite animated. They had all four remained on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.205#pavement, amidst the pushing at the entrance. Little by little, however,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.206#the stream carried them in; and they had only to abandon themselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.207#to the current, they passed the door as if lifted up, without being
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.208#conscious of it, talking louder to make themselves heard. They were now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.209#asking each other about Madame Marty; it was said that poor Monsieur
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.210#Marty, after violent scenes at home, had gone quite mad; he was diving
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.211#into all the treasures of the earth, exhausting mines of gold, loading
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.212#tumbrils with diamonds and precious stones.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.213#“Poor fellow!” said Madame Guibal, “he who was always so shabby, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.214#his teacher's humility! And the wife?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.215#“She's ruining an uncle, now,” replied Henriette, “a worthy old man who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.216#has gone to live with her, having lost his wife. But she must be here,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.217#we shall see her.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.218#A surprise made the ladies stop short. Before them extended the shop,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.219#the largest drapery establishment in the world, as the advertisements
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.220#said. The grand central gallery now ran from end to end, extending from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.221#the Rue du Dix-Décembre to the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin; whilst to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.222#right and to the left, like the aisles of a church, ran the Monsigny
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.223#Gallery and the Michodière Gallery, right along the two streets, without
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.224#a break. Here and there the halls crossed and formed open spaces amidst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.225#the metallic framework of the suspended stairs and flying bridges. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.226#inside arrangements had been all changed: the bargains were now placed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.227#on the Rue du Dix-Décembre side, the silk department was in the centre,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.228#the glove department occupied the Saint-Augustin Hall at the back; and,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.229#from the new grand vestibule, one beheld, on looking up, the bedding
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.230#department, moved from one end of the second floor to the other. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.231#number of departments now amounted to the enormous figure of fifty;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.232#several, quite fresh, were to be inaugurated that very day; others,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.233#become too important, had been simply divided, in order to facilitate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.234#the sales; and, owing to this continual increase of business, the staff
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.235#had been increased to three thousand and forty-five employees.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.236#What caused the ladies to stop was the prodigious spectacle of the grand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.237#exhibition of white goods. In the first place, there was the vestibule,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.238#a hall with bright mirrors, paved with mosaics, where the low-priced
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.239#goods detained the voracious crowd. Then there were the galleries,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.240#plunged in a glittering blaze of light, a borealistic vista, quite a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.241#country of snow, revealing the endless steppes hung with ermine, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.242#accumulation of icebergs shimmering in the sun. One found there the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.243#whiteness of the outside windows, but vivified, colossal, burning from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.244#one end of the enormous building to the other, with the white flame of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.245#fire in full swing. Nothing but white goods, all the white articles from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.246#each department, a riot of white, a white star, the twinkling of which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.247#was at first blinding, so that the details could not be distinguished
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.248#amidst this unique whiteness. But the eye soon became accustomed to it;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.249#to the left, in the Monsigny Gallery, jutted out the white promontories
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.250#of cotton and calico, the white rocks formed of sheets, napkins, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.251#handkerchiefs; whilst to the right, in the Michodière Gallery, occupied
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.252#by the mercery, the hosiery, and the woollen goods, were exposed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.253#constructions of mother of pearl buttons, a pretty decoration composed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.254#of white socks, one whole room covered with white swanskin, traversed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.255#in the distance by a stream of light. But the brightness shone with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.256#especial brilliancy in the central gallery, amidst the ribbons and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.257#cravats, the gloves and the silks. The counters disappeared beneath the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.258#whiteness of the silks, the ribbons, and the gloves.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.259#Round the iron columns were twined flounces of white muslin, looped
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.260#up now and again with white silk handkerchiefs. The staircases were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.261#decorated with white drapings, quiltings and dimities alternating along
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.262#the balustrades, encircling the halls as high as the second storey; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.263#this tide of white assumed wings, hurried off and lost itself, like a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.264#flight of swans. And the white hung from the arches, a fall of down, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.265#snowy sheet of large flakes; white counterpanes, white coverlets floated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.266#about in the air, suspended like banners in a church; long jets
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.267#of Maltese lace hung across, seeming to suspend swarms of white
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.268#butterflies; other lace fluttered about on all sides, floating like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.269#fleecy clouds in a summer sky, filling the air with their clear breath.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.270#And the marvel, the altar of this religion of white was, above the silk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.271#counter, in the great hall, a tent formed of white curtains, which fell
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.272#from the glazed roof. The muslin, the gauze, the lace flowed in light
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.273#ripples, whilst very richly embroidered tulles, and pieces of oriental
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.274#silk striped with silver, served as a background to this giant
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.275#decoration, which partook of the tabernacle and of the alcove. It made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.276#one think of a broad white bed, awaiting in its virginal immensity
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.277#the white princess, as in the legend, she who was to come one day, all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.278#powerful, with the bride's white veil.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.279#“Oh! extraordinary!” repeated the ladies. “Wonderful!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.280#They never tired of this song in praise of white that the goods of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.281#entire establishment were singing. Mouret had never conceived anything
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.282#more extraordinary; it was the master stroke of his genius for display.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.283#Beneath the flow of all this whiteness, in the apparent disorder of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.284#the tissues, fallen as if by chance from the open drawers, there was a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.285#harmonious phrase, the white followed up and developed in all its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.286#tones, springing into existence, growing, and blossoming forth with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.287#complicated orchestration of a master's fugue, the continual development
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.288#of which carries away the mind in an ever-increasing flight. Nothing but
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.289#white, and never the same goods, all styles outvying with, opposing, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.290#completing one another, attaining the very brilliancy of light itself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.291#Starting from the dull shades of the calico and linen, and the heavy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.292#shades of the flannel and cloth, there then came the velvet, silk, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.293#satin goods--quite an ascending gamut, the white gradually lighted up,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.294#finishing in little flames at the breaks of the folds; and the white
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.295#flew away in the transparencies of the curtains, becoming free and clear
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.296#with the muslin, the lace, and above all the tulle, so light and airy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.297#that it was like the extreme and last note; whilst the silver of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.298#oriental silk sung higher than all in the depths of the giant alcove.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.299#The place was full of life. The lifts were besieged with people, there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.300#was a crush at the refreshment-bar and in the reading-room, quite a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.301#nation was moving about in these regions covered with the snowy fabrics.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.302#And the crowd seemed to be black, like skaters on a Polish lake in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.303#December. On the ground floor there was a heavy swell, agitated by a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.304#reflux, in which could be distinguished nothing but the delicate and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.305#enraptured faces of the women. In the chisellings of the iron framework,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.306#along the staircases, on the flying bridges, there was an endless
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.307#procession of small figures, as if lost amidst the snowy peaks of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.308#mountain. A suffocating hot-house heat surprised one on these frozen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.309#heights. The buzz of voices made a great noise like a rushing stream. Up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.310#above, the profusion of gildings, the glazed work picked out with gold,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.311#and the golden roses seemed like a ray of the sun shining on the Alps of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.312#the grand exhibition of white goods.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.313#“Come,” said Madame de Boves, “we must go forward. It's impossible to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.314#stay here.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.315#Since she came in, Jouve, the inspector, standing near the door, had not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.316#taken his eyes off her; and when she turned round she encountered his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.317#gaze. Then, as she resumed her walk, he let her get a little in front,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.318#but followed her at a distance, without, however, appearing to take any
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.319#further notice of her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.320#“Ah!” said Madame Guibal, stopping again as she came to the first
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.321#pay-desk, “it's a pretty idea, these violets!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.322#She referred to the new present made by The Ladies' Paradise, one of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.323#Mouret's ideas, which was making a great noise in the newspapers; small
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.324#bouquets of white violets, bought by thousands at Nice and distributed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.325#to every customer buying the smallest article. Near each pay-desk were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.326#messengers in uniform, delivering the bouquets under the supervision
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.327#of an inspector. And gradually all the customers were decorated in this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.328#way, the shop was filling with these white flowers, every woman becoming
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.329#the bearer of a penetrating perfume of violets.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.330#“Yes,” murmured Madame Desforges, in a jealous voice, “it's not a bad
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.331#idea.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.332#But, just as they were going away, they heard two shopmen joking about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.333#these violets. A tall, thin fellow was expressing his astonishment:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.334#the marriage between the governor and the first-hand in the costume
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.335#department was coming off, then? whilst a short, fat fellow replied that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.336#he didn't know, but that the flowers were bought at any rate.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.337#“What!” exclaimed Madame de Boves, “Monsieur Mouret is going to marry?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.338#“That's the latest news,” replied Madame Desforges, affecting the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.339#greatest indifference. “Of course, he's sure to end like that.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.340#The countess shot a quick glance at her new friend. They both now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.341#understood why Madame Desforges had come to The Ladies' Paradise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.342#notwithstanding her rupture with Mouret. No doubt she yielded to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.343#invincible desire to see and to suffer.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.344#“I shall stay with you,” said Madame Guibal, whose curiosity was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.345#awakened. “We shall meet Madame de Boves again in the reading-room.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.346#“Very good,” replied the latter. “I want to go on the first floor. Come
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.347#along, Blanche.” And she went up followed by her daughter, whilst Jouve,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.348#the inspector, still on her track, ascended by another staircase, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.349#order not to attract attention. The two other ladies were soon lost in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.350#the compact crowd on the ground floor.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.351#All the counters were talking of nothing else but the governor's love
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.352#affairs, amidst the press of business. The adventure, which had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.353#for months been occupying the employees, delighted at Denise's long
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.354#resistance, had all at once come to a crisis; it had become known that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.355#the young girl intended to leave The Ladies' Paradise, notwithstanding
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.356#all Mouret's entreaties, under the pretext of requiring rest. And the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.357#opinions were divided. Would she leave? Would she stay? Bets of five
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.358#francs circulated from department to department that she would leave the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.359#following Sunday. The knowing ones staked a lunch on the final marriage;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.360#however, the others, those who believed in her departure, did not risk
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.361#their money without good reasons. Certainly the little girl had the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.362#strength of an adored woman who refuses, but the governor, on his side,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.363#was strong in his wealth, his happy widowerhood, and his pride which a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.364#last exaction might exasperate. Nevertheless, they were all of opinion
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.365#that this little saleswoman had carried on the business with the science
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.366#of a _rouée_, full of genius, and that she was playing the supreme stake
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.367#in thus offering him this bargain: Marry me or I go away.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.368#Denise, however, thought but little of these things. She had never
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.369#imposed any conditions or made any calculation. And the reason of her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.370#departure was the result of this very judgment of her conduct, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.371#caused her continual surprise. Had she wished for all this? Had she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.372#shown herself artful, coquettish, ambitious? No, she had come simply,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.373#and was the first to feel astonished at inspiring this passion. And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.374#again, now, why did they ascribe her resolution to quit The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.375#Paradise to craftiness? It was so natural! She began to feel a nervous
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.376#uneasiness, an intolerable anguish, amidst this continual gossip which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.377#was going on in the house, Mouret's feverish pursuit of her, and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.378#combats she was obliged to engage in against herself; and she preferred
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.379#to go away, seized with fear lest she might one day yield and regret it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.380#for ever afterwards. If there were in this any learned tactics, she was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.381#totally ignorant of it, and she asked herself in despair what was to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.382#be done to avoid appearing to be running after a husband. The idea of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.383#marriage now irritated her, and she resolved to say no, and still no, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.384#case he should push his folly to that extent. She alone ought to suffer.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.385#The necessity for the separation caused her tears to flow, but she told
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.386#herself, with her great courage, that it was necessary, that she would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.387#have no rest or happiness if she acted in any other way.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.388#When Mouret received her resignation, he remained mute and cold, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.389#effort which he made to contain himself. Then he replied that he granted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.390#her a week's reflection, before allowing her to commit such a stupid
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.391#act. At the expiration of the week, when she returned to the subject,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.392#and expressed a strong wish to go away after the great sale, he said
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.393#nothing further, but affected to talk the language of reason to her: she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.394#had little or no fortune, she would never find another position equal to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.395#that she was leaving. Had she another situation in view? If so, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.396#was quite prepared to offer her the advantages she expected to obtain
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.397#elsewhere. And the young girl having replied that she had not looked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.398#for any other situation, that she intended to take a rest at Valognes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.399#thanks to the money she had already saved, he asked her what would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.400#prevent her returning to The Ladies' Paradise if her health alone were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.401#the reason of her departure. She remained silent, tortured by this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.402#cross-examination. He at once imagined that she was about to join
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.403#a lover, a future husband perhaps. Had she not confessed to him one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.404#evening that she loved some one? From that moment he carried deep in his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.405#heart, like the stab of a knife, this confession wrung from her in an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.406#hour of trouble. And if this man was to marry her, she was giving up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.407#all to follow him: that explained her obstinacy. It was all over, and he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.408#simply added in his icy tones, that he would detain her no longer, since
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.409#she could not tell him the real cause of her leaving. These harsh words,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.410#free from anger, affected her far more than the anger she had feared.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.411#Throughout the week that Denise was obliged to spend in the shop, Mouret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.412#kept his rigid paleness. When he crossed the departments, he affected
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.413#not to see her, never had he seemed more indifferent, more buried in his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.414#work; and the bets began again, only the brave ones dared to back the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.415#marriage. However, beneath this coldness, so unusual with him, Mouret
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.416#concealed a frightful crisis of indecision and suffering. Fits of anger
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.417#brought the blood to his head: he saw red, he dreamed of taking Denise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.418#in a close embrace, keeping her, and stifling her cries. Then he tried
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.419#to reason with himself, to find some practical means of preventing her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.420#going away; but he constantly ran up against his powerlessness, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.421#uselessness of his power and money. An idea, however, was growing amidst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.422#his mad projects, and gradually imposing itself, notwithstanding his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.423#revolt. After Madame Hédouin's death he had sworn never to marry again;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.424#deriving from a woman his first good fortune, he resolved in future to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.425#draw his fortune from all women. It was with him, as with Bourdoncle,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.426#a superstition that the head of a great drapery establishment should
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.427#be single, if he wished to retain his masculine power over the growing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.428#desires of his world of customers; the introduction of a woman changed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.429#the air, drove away the others, by bringing her own odour. And he still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.430#resisted the invincible logic of facts, preferring to die rather than
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.431#yield, seized with sudden bursts of fury against Denise, feeling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.432#that she was the revenge, fearing he should fall vanquished over his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.433#millions, broken like a straw by the eternal feminine force, the day he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.434#should marry her. Then he slowly became cowardly again, dismissing his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.435#repugnance; why tremble? she was so sweet-tempered, so prudent, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.436#he could abandon himself to her without fear. Twenty times an hour the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.437#battle recommenced in his distracted mind. His pride tended to aggravate
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.438#the wound, and he completely lost his reason when he thought that,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.439#even after this last submission, she might still say no, if she loved
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.440#another. The morning of the great sale, he had still not decided on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.441#anything, and Denise was to leave the next day.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.442#When Bourdoncle, on the day in question, entered Mouret's office about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.443#three o'clock, according to custom, he surprised him sitting with his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.444#elbows on the desk, his hands over his eyes, so greatly absorbed that he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.445#had to touch him on the shoulder. Mouret glanced up, his face bathed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.446#in tears; they both looked at each other, held out their hands, and a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.447#hearty grip was exchanged between these two men who had fought so
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.448#many commercial battles side by side. For the past month Bourdoncle's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.449#attitude had completely changed; he now bowed before Denise, and even
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.450#secretly pushed the governor on to a marriage with her. No doubt he was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.451#thus manoeuvring to save himself being swept away by a force which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.452#he now recognised as superior. But there could have been found at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.453#bottom of this change the awakening of an old ambition, the timid and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.454#gradually growing hope to swallow up in his turn this Mouret, before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.455#whom he had so long bowed. This was in the air of the house, in this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.456#struggle for existence, of which the continued massacres warmed up the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.457#business around him. He was carried away by the working of the machine,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.458#seized by the others' appetites, by that voracity which, from top to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.459#bottom, drove the lean ones to the extermination of the fat ones. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.460#a sort of religions fear, the religion of chance, had up to that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.461#time prevented him making the attempt. And the governor was becoming
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.462#childish, drifting into a ridiculous marriage, ruining his luck,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.463#destroying his charm with the customers. Why should he dissuade him from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.464#it, when he could so easily take up the business of this played-out
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.465#man, fallen into the arms of a woman? Thus it was with the emotion of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.466#an adieu, the pity of an old friendship, that he shook his chiefs hand,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.467#saying:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.468#“Come, come, courage! Marry her, and finish the matter.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.469#Mouret already felt ashamed of his moment of cowardice, and got up,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.470#protesting: “No, no, it's too stupid. Come, let's take our turn round
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.471#the shop. Things are looking well, aren't they? I fancy we shall have a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.472#magnificent day.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.473#They went out and commenced their afternoon inspection through the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.474#crowded departments. Bourdoncle cast oblique glances at him, anxious at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.475#this last display of energy, watching his lips to catch the least sign
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.476#of suffering. The business was in fact throwing forth its fire, in an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.477#infernal roar, which made the house tremble with the violent shaking of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.478#a big steamer going at full speed. At Denise's counter were a crowd of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.479#mothers dragging along their little girls and boys, swamped beneath the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.480#garments they were trying on. The department had brought out all its
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.481#white articles, and there, as everywhere else, was a riot of white,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.482#enough to dress in white a troop of shivering cupids, white cloth
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.483#cloaks, white piques and cashmere dresses, sailor costumes, and even
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.484#white Zouave costumes. In the centre, for the sake of the effect,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.485#and although the season had not arrived, was a display of communion
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.486#costumes, the white muslin dress and veil, the white satin shoes, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.487#light gushing florescence, which, planted there, produced the effect of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.488#an enormous bouquet of innocence and candid delight. Madame Bourdelais
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.489#was there with her three children, Madeleine, Edmond, Lucien, seated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.490#according to their size, and was getting angry with the latter, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.491#smallest, because he was struggling with Denise, who was trying to put a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.492#woollen muslin jacket on him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.493#“Keep still, Lucien! Don't you think it's rather tight, mademoiselle?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.494# And with the sharp look of a woman difficult to deceive, she examined
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.495#the stuff, studied the cut, and scrutinized the stitching. “No, it fits
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.496#well,” she resumed. “It's no trifle to dress all these little ones. Now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.497#I want a mantle for this young lady.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.498#Denise had been obliged to assist in serving during the busy moments of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.499#the day. She was looking for the mantle required, when she set up a cry
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.500#of surprise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.501#“What! It's you; what's the matter?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.502#Her brother Jean, holding a parcel in his hand, was standing before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.503#her. He had married a week before, and on the Saturday his wife, a dark
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.504#little woman, with a provoking, charming face, had paid a long visit to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.505#The Ladies' Paradise to make some purchases. The young people were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.506#to accompany Denise to Valognes, a regular marriage trip, a month's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.507#holiday, which would remind them of old times.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.508#“Just imagine,” said he, “Thérèse has forgotten a lot of things. There
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.509#are some articles to be changed, and others to be bought. So, as she was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.510#in a hurry, she sent me with this parcel. I'll explain----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.511#But she interrupted him on perceiving Pépé, “What; Pépé as well! and his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.512#school?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.513#“Well,” said Jean, “after dinner on Sunday I had not the heart to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.514#take him back. He will go back this evening. The poor child is very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.515#downhearted at being shut up in Paris whilst we are enjoying ourselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.516#at home.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.517#Denise smiled on them, in spite of her suffering. She handed over Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.518#Bourdelais to one of her young ladies, and came back to them in a corner
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.519#of the department, which was, fortunately, getting deserted. The little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.520#ones, as she still called them, had now grown to be big fellows. Pépé,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.521#twelve years old, was already taller and bigger than her, still silent
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.522#and living on caresses, of a charming, cajolling sweetness; whilst Jean,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.523#broad-shouldered, was quite a head taller than his sister, and still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.524#possessed his feminine beauty, with his blonde hair blowing about in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.525#wind. And she, always slim, no fatter than a skylark, as she said, still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.526#retained her anxious motherly authority over them, treating them as
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.527#children wanting all her attention, buttoning up Jean's coat so that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.528#he should not look like a rake, and seeing that Pépé had got a clean
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.529#handkerchief. When she saw the latter's swollen eyes, she gently chided
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.530#him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.531#“Be reasonable, my boy. Your studies cannot be interrupted. I'll take
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.532#you away at the holidays. Is there anything you want? But perhaps you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.533#prefer to have the money.” Then she turned towards the other. “You,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.534#youngster, yet making him believe we are going to have wonderful fun!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.535#Just try and be a little more careful.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.536#She had given Jean four thousand francs, half of her savings, to enable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.537#him to set up housekeeping. The younger one cost her a great deal for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.538#schooling, all her money went for them, as in former days. They were her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.539#sole reason for living and working, for she had again declared she would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.540#never marry.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.541#“Well, here are the things,” resumed Jean. “In the first place, there's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.542#a cloak in this parcel that Thérèse----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.543#But he stopped, and Denise, on turning round to see what had frightened
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.544#him, perceived Mouret behind them. For a moment he had stood looking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.545#at her in her motherly attitude between the two big boys, scolding and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.546#embracing them, turning them round as mothers do babies when changing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.547#their clothes. Bourdoncle had remained on one side, appearing to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.548#interested in the business, but he did not lose sight of this little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.549#scene.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.550#“They are your brothers, are they not?” asked Mouret, after a silence.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.551#He had the icy tone and rigid attitude, which he now assumed with her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.552#Denise herself made an effort to remain cold and unconcerned. Her smile
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.553#died away, and she replied: “Yes, sir. I've married off the eldest, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.554#his wife has sent him for some purchases.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.555#Mouret continued looking at the three of them. At last he said: “The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.556#youngest has grown very much. I recognise him, I remember having seen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.557#him in the Tuileries Gardens one evening with you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.558#And his voice, which was becoming moderate, slightly trembled. She,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.559#suffocating, bent down, pretending to arrange Pépé's belt. The two
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.560#brothers, who had turned scarlet, stood smiling on their sister's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.561#master.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.562#“They're very much like you,” said the latter.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.563#“Oh!” exclaimed she, “they're much handsomer than I am!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.564#For a moment he seemed to be comparing their faces. How she loved them!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.565#And he walked a step or two; then returned and whispered in her ear:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.566#“Come to my office after business, I want to speak to you before you go
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.567#away.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.568#This time Mouret went off and continued his inspection. The battle was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.569#once more raging within him, for the appointment he had given caused him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.570#a sort of irritation. To what idea had he yielded on seeing her with her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.571#brothers? It was maddening to think he could no longer find the strength
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.572#to assert his will. However, he could settle it by saying a word of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.573#adieu. Bourdoncle, who had rejoined him, seemed less anxious, though he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.574#was still examining him with stealthy glances.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.575#Meanwhile Denise had returned to Madame Bourdelais. “How are you getting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.576#on with the mantle, madame?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.577#“Oh, very well. I've spent enough for one day. These little ones are
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.578#ruining me!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.579#Denise now being able to slip away, went and listened to Jean's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.580#explanations, then accompanied him to the various counters, where he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.581#would certainly have lost his head without her. First came the mantle,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.582#which Thérèse wished to change for a white cloth cloak, same size,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.583#same shape. And the young girl, having taken the parcel, went up to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.584#ready-made department, followed by her two brothers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.585#The department had laid out its light coloured garments, summer jackets
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.586#and mantillas, of light silk and fancy woollens. But there was little
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.587#doing here, the customers were but few and far between. Nearly all the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.588#young ladies were new-comers. Clara had disappeared a month before, some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.589#said she had eloped with the husband of one of the saleswomen, others
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.590#that she had gone on the streets. As for Marguerite, she was at last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.591#about to take the management of the little shop at Grenoble, where her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.592#cousin was waiting for her. Madame Aurélie remained immutable, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.593#round cuirass of her silk dress, with her imperial mask which retained
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.594#the yellowish puffiness of an antique marble. Her son Albert's bad
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.595#conduct was a source of great trouble to her, and she would have retired
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.596#into the country had it not been for the inroads made on the family
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.597#savings by this scapegrace, whose terrible extravagance threatened to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.598#swallow up piece by piece their Rigolles property. It was a sort of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.599#punishment for their home broken up, for the mother had resumed her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.600#little excursions with her lady friends, and the father on his side
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.601#continued his musical performances. Bourdoncle was already looking upon
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.602#Madame Aurélie with a discontented air, surprised that she had not the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.603#tact to resign; too old for business! the knell was about to sound which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.604#would sweep away the Lhomme dynasty.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.605#“Ah! it's you,” said she to Denise, with an exaggerated amiability.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.606#“You want this cloak changed, eh? Certainly, at once. Ah! there are your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.607#brothers; getting quite men, I declare!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.608#In spite of her pride, she would have gone on her knees to pay her court
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.609#to the young girl. Nothing else was being talked of in her department,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.610#as in the others, but Denise's departure; and the first-hand was quite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.611#ill over it, for she had been reckoning on the protection of her former
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.612#saleswoman. She lowered her voice: “They say you're going to leave us.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.613#Really, it isn't possible?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.614#“But it is, though,” replied Denise.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.615#Marguerite was listening. Since her marriage had been decided on, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.616#had marched about with her putty-looking face, assuming more disdainful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.617#airs than ever. She came up saying: “You are quite right. Self-respect
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.618#above everything, I say. Allow me to bid you adieu, my dear.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.619#Some customers arriving at that moment, Madame Aurélie requested her,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.620#in a harsh voice, to attend to business. Then, as Denise was taking
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.621#the cloak to effect the “return” herself, she protested, and called an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.622#auxiliary. This, again, was an innovation suggested to Mouret by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.623#young girl--persons charged with carrying the articles, which relieved
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.624#the saleswomen of a great burden.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.625#“Go with Mademoiselle Denise,” said the first-hand, giving her the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.626#cloak. Then, returning to Denise: “Pray consider well. We are all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.627#heart-broken at your leaving.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.628#Jean and Pépé, who were waiting, smiling amidst this overflowing crowd
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.629#of women, followed their sister. They now had to go to the underlinen
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.630#department, to get four chemises like the half-dozen that Thérèse had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.631#bought on the Saturday. But there, where the exhibition of white goods
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.632#was snowing down from every shelf, they were almost stifled, and found
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.633#it very difficult to get past.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.634#In the first place, at the stay counter a little scene was causing a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.635#crowd to collect. Madame Boutarel, who had arrived in Paris this time
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.636#with her husband and daughter, had been wandering all about the shop
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.637#since the morning collecting an outfit for the young lady, who was about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.638#to be married. The father was consulted every moment, and they never
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.639#appeared likely to finish. At last the family had just stranded here;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.640#and whilst the young lady was absorbed in a profound study of some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.641#drawers, the mother had disappeared, having cast her coquettish eyes on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.642#a delicious pair of stays. When Monsieur Boutarel, a big, full-blooded
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.643#man, left his daughter, bewildered, to go and look for his wife, he at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.644#last found her in a fitting-room, at the door of which he was politely
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.645#invited to take a seat. These rooms were like narrow cells, glazed with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.646#ground glass, where the men, and even the husbands, were not allowed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.647#to enter, by an exaggerated sentiment of propriety on the part of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.648#directors. Saleswomen came out and went in again quickly, allowing those
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.649#outside to divine, by the rapid closing of the door, visions of ladies
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.650#in their petticoats, with bare arms and shoulders--stout women with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.651#white flesh, and thin ones with flesh the colour of old ivory. A row of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.652#men were waiting outside, seated on arm-chairs, and looking very weary.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.653#Monsieur Boutarel, when he understood, got really angry, crying out
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.654#that he wanted his wife, that he insisted on knowing what was going on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.655#inside, that he certainly would not allow her to undress without him. It
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.656#was in vain that they tried to calm him; he seemed to think there were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.657#some very queer things going on inside. Madame Boutarel was obliged to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.658#come out, to the delight of the crowd, who were discussing and laughing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.659#over the affair.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.660#Denise and her brothers were at last able to get past. Every article of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.661#female linen, all those white under-things that are usually concealed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.662#were here displayed, in a suite of rooms, classed in various
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.663#departments. The corsets and dress-improvers occupied one counter, there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.664#were the stitched corsets, the Duchesse, the cuirass, and, above all,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.665#the white silk corsets, dove-tailed with colours, forming for this day
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.666#a special display; an army of dummies without heads or legs, nothing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.667#but the bust, dolls' breasts flattened under the silk, and close by,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.668#on other dummies, were horse-hair and other dress improvers, prolonging
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.669#these broomsticks into enormous, distended croups, of which the profile
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.670#assumed a ludicrous unbecomingness. But afterwards commenced the gallant
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.671#dishabille, a dishabille which strewed the vast rooms, as if an army
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.672#of lovely girls had undressed themselves from department to department,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.673#down to the very satin of their skin. Here were articles of fine linen,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.674#white cuffs and cravats, white fichus and collars, an infinite variety
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.675#of light gewgaws, a white froth which escaped from the drawers and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.676#ascended like so much snow. There were jackets, little bodices, morning
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.677#dresses and peignoirs, linen, nansouck, long white garments, roomy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.678#and thin, which spoke of the lounging in a lazy morning after a night
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.679#of tenderness. Then appeared the under-garments, falling one by one; the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.680#white petticoats of all lengths, the petticoat that clings to the knees,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.681#and the long petticoat with which the gay ladies sweep the pavement, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.682#rising sea of petticoats, in which the legs were drowned; cotton, linen,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.683#and cambric drawers, large white drawers in which a man could dance;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.684#lastly, the chemises, buttoned at the neck for the night, or displaying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.685#the bosom in the day, simply supported by narrow shoulder-straps;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.686#chemises in all materials, common calico, Irish linen, cambric, the last
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.687#white veil slipping from the panting bosom and hips.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.688#And, at the outfitting counter, there was an indiscreet unpacking, women
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.689#turned round and viewed on all sides, from the small housewife with her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.690#common calicoes, to the rich lady drowned in laces, an alcove publicly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.691#open, of which the concealed luxury, the plaitings, the embroideries,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.692#the Valenciennes lace, became a sort of sexual depravation, as it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.693#developed into costly fantasies. Woman was dressing herself again, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.694#white wave of this fall of linen was returning again to the shivering
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.695#mystery of the petticoats, the chemise stiffened by the fingers of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.696#workwomen, the frigid drawers retaining the creases of the box, all this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.697#cambric and muslin, dead, scattered over the counters, thrown about,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.698#heaped up, was going to become living, with the life of the flesh,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.699#odorous and warm with the odour of love, a white cloud become sacred,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.700#bathed in night, and of which the least flutter, the pink of a knee
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.701#disclosed through the whiteness, ravaged the world. Then there was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.702#another room devoted to the baby linen, where the voluptuous snowy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.703#whiteness of woman's clothing developed into the chaste whiteness of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.704#the infant: an innocence, a joy, the young wife become a mother, flannel
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.705#garments, chemises and caps large as doll's things, baptismal dresses,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.706#cashmere pelisses, the white down of birth, like a fine shower of white
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.707#feathers.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.708#“They are embroidered chemises,” said Jean, who was delighted with this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.709#display, this rising tide of feminine attire into which he was plunging.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.710#Pauline ran up at once, when she perceived Denise; and before even
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.711#asking what she wanted, began to talk in a low tone, stirred up by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.712#rumours circulating in the shop. In her department, two saleswomen had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.713#even got quarrelling, one affirming and the other denying her departure.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.714#“You'll stay with us, I'll stake my life. What would become of me?” And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.715#as Denise replied that she intended to leave the next day. “No, no, you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.716#think so, but I know better. You must appoint me second-hand, now that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.717#I've got a baby. Baugé is reckoning on it, my dear.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.718#Pauline smiled with an air of conviction. She then gave the six
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.719#chemises; and, Jean having said that he was now going to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.720#handkerchief counter, she called an auxiliary to carry the chemises and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.721#the jacket left by the auxiliary from the readymade department The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.722#girl who happened to answer was Mademoiselle de Fontenailles, recently
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.723#married to Joseph. She had just obtained this menial situation as a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.724#great favour, and she wore a long black blouse, marked on the shoulder
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.725#with a number in yellow wool.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.726#“Follow this young lady,” said Pauline. Then returning, and again
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.727#lowering her voice: “It's understood that I am to be appointed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.728#second-hand, eh?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.729#Denise, troubled, defended herself; but at last promised, with a laugh,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.730#joking in her turn. And she went away, going down with Jean and Pépé,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.731#and followed by the auxiliary. On the ground-floor, they fell into
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.732#the woollen department, a corner of a gallery entirely hung with white
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.733#swanskin cloth and white flannel. Liénard, whom his father had vainly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.734#recalled to Angers, was talking to the handsome Mignot, now a traveller,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.735#and who had boldly reappeared at The Ladies' Paradise. No doubt they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.736#were speaking of Denise, for they both stopped talking to bow to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.737#her with a ceremonious air. In fact, as she went along through the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.738#departments the salesmen appeared full of emotion and bent their heads
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.739#before her, uncertain of what she might be the next day. They whispered,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.740#thought she looked triumphant, and the betting was again altered;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.741#they began to risk bottles of wine, etc., over the event. She had gone
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.742#through the linen-gallery, in order to get to the handkerchief counter,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.743#which was at the further end. They saw nothing but white goods: cottons,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.744#madapolams, muslins, etc.; then came the linen, in enormous piles,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.745#ranged in alternate pieces like blocks of stone, stout linen, fine
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.746#linen, of all sizes, white and unbleached, pure flax, whitened in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.747#sun; then the same thing commenced once more, there were departments for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.748#each sort of linen: house linen, table linen, kitchen linen, a continual
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.749#fall of white goods, sheets, pillow-cases, innumerable styles of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.750#napkins, aprons, and dusters. And the bowing continued, they made way
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.751#for Denise to pass, Baugé had rushed out to smile on her, as the good
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.752#fairy of the house. At last, after crossing the counterpane department,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.753#a room hung with white banners, she arrived at the handkerchief counter,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.754#the ingenious decoration of which delighted the crowd; there were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.755#nothing but white columns, white pyramids, white castles, a complicated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.756#architecture, solely composed of handkerchiefs, cambric, Irish linen,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.757#China silk, marked, embroidered by hand, trimmed with lace, hemstitched,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.758#and woven with vignettes, an entire city, built of white bricks, of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.759#infinite variety, standing out in a mirage against an Eastern sky,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.760#warmed to a white heat.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.761#“You say another dozen?” asked Denise of her brother.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.762#“Yes, like this one,” replied he, showing a handkerchief in his parcel.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.763#Jean and Pépé had not quitted her side, clinging to her, as they had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.764#done formerly, on arriving in Paris, knocked up by the journey. This
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.765#vast shop, in which she was quite at home, seemed to trouble them, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.766#they sheltered themselves in her shadow, placing themselves under the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.767#protection of their second mother by an instinctive awakening of their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.768#infancy. People watched them as they passed, smiling at the two big
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.769#fellows following in the footsteps of this grave thin girl; Jean
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.770#frightened with his beard, Pépé bewildered in his tunic, all three of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.771#the same fair complexion, a fairness which caused the whisper from one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.772#end of the counters to the other: “They are her brothers! They are her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.773#brothers!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.774#But whilst Denise was looking for a saleswoman there was a meeting.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.775#Mouret and Bourdoncle entered the gallery; and as the former again
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.776#stopped in front of the young girl, without, however, speaking to her,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.777#Madame Desforges and Madame Guibal passed by. Henriette suppressed the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.778#shiver which had invaded her whole being; she looked at Mouret and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.779#then at Denise. They had also looked at her, and it was a sort of mute
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.780#catastrophe, the common end of these great dramas of the heart, a glance
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.781#exchanged in the crush of a crowd. Mouret had already gone off, whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.782#Denise lost herself in the depths of the department, accompanied by her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.783#brothers, still in search of a disengaged salesman. But Henriette having
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.784#recognised Mademoiselle de Fontenailles, in the auxiliary following
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.785#Denise, with a yellow number on her shoulder, and her coarse,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.786#cadaverous, servant's-looking face, relieved herself by saying to Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.787#Guibal, in a trembling voice:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.788#“Just see what he's doing with that unfortunate girl. Isn't it shameful?
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.789#A marchioness! And he makes her follow like a dog the creatures picked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.790#up by him in the street!” She tried to calm herself, adding, with an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.791#affected air of indifference: “Let's go and see their display of silks.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.792#The silk department was like a great chamber of love, hung with white
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.793#by the caprice of some snowy maiden wishing to show off her spotless
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.794#whiteness. All the milky tones of an adored person were there, from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.795#velvet of the hips, to the fine silk of the thighs and the shining satin
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.796#of the bosom. Pieces of velvet hung from the columns, silk and satins
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.797#stood out, on this white creamy ground, in draperies of a metallic and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.798#porcelain-like whiteness: and falling in arches were also poult and gros
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.799#grain silks, light foulards, and surahs, which varied from the heavy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.800#white of a Norwegian blonde to the transparent white, warmed by the sun,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.801#of an Italian or a Spanish beauty.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.802#Favier was just then engaged in measuring some white silk for “the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.803#pretty lady,” that elegant blonde, a frequent customer at the counter,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.804#and whom the salesmen never referred to except by this name. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.805#had dealt at the shop for years, and yet they knew nothing about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.806#her--neither her life, her address, and not even her name. None of them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.807#tried to find out, although they all indulged in supposition every time
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.808#she made her appearance, but simply for something to talk about. She
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.809#was getting thinner, she was getting stouter, she had slept well, or she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.810#must have been out late the previous night--such were the remarks made
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.811#about her: thus every little fact of her unknown life, outside events,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.812#domestic dramas, were in this way reproduced and commented on. That day
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.813#she seemed very gay. So, on returning from the pay-desk where he had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.814#conducted her, Favier remarked to Hutin:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.815#“Perhaps she's going to marry again.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.816#“What! is she a widow?” asked the other.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.817#“I don't know; but you must remember that she was in mourning the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.818#last time she came. Unless she's made some money by speculating on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.819#Bourse.” A silence ensued. At last he ended by saying: “But that's her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.820#business. It wouldn't do to take notice of all the women we see here.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.821#But Hutin was looking very thoughtful, having had, two days ago, a warm
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.822#discussion with the direction, and feeling himself condemned. After the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.823#great sale his dismissal was certain. For a long time he had felt his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.824#position giving way; at the last stock-taking they had complained of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.825#being below the amount of business fixed on in advance; and it was also,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.826#in fact chiefly, the slow working of the appetites that were swallowing
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.827#him up in his turn--the whole silent war of the department, amidst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.828#the very motion of the machine. Favier's obscure mining could be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.829#perceived--a deadened sound as of jaw-bones working under the earth.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.830#The latter had already received the promise of the first-hand's place.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.831#Hutin, who was aware of all this, instead of attacking his old comrade,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.832#looked upon him as a clever fellow--a fellow who had always appeared
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.833#so cold, so obedient, whom he had made use of to turn out Robineau and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.834#Bouthemont! He was full of a feeling of mingled surprise and respect.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.835#“By the way,” resumed Favier, “she's going to stay, you know. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.836#governor has just been seen casting sheep's eyes at her. I shall be let
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.837#in for a bottle of champagne over it.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.838#He referred to Denise. The gossip was going on more than ever, from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.839#one counter to the other, across the constantly increasing crowd of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.840#customers. The silk sellers were especially excited, for they had been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.841#taking heavy bets about it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.842#“By Jove!” exclaimed Hutin, waking up as if from a dream, “wasn't I a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.843#flat not to have slept with her! I should be all right now!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.844#Then he blushed at this confession on seeing Favier laughing. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.845#pretended to laugh also, and added, to recall his words, that it was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.846#this creature that had ruined him with the management However, a desire
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.847#for violence seizing him, he finished by getting into a rage with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.848#salesmen disbanded under the assault of the customers. But all at once
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.849#he resumed his smile, having just perceived Madame Desforges and Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.850#Guibal slowly crossing the department.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.851#“What can we serve you with to-day, madame?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.852#“Nothing, thanks,” replied Henriette. “You see I'm merely walking round;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.853#I've only come out of curiosity.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.854#When he had stopped her, he lowered his voice. Quite a plan was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.855#springing up in his head. And he flattered her, running down the house;
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.856#he had had enough of it, and preferred going away to assisting at such
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.857#a scene of disorder. She listened to him, delighted. It was she herself
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.858#who, thinking to get him away from The Ladies' Paradise, offered to have
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.859#him engaged by Bouthemont as first-hand in the silk department, when The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.860#Four Seasons started again. The matter was settled in whispers, whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.861#Madame Guibal interested herself in the displays.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.862#“May I offer you one of these bouquets of violets?” resumed Hutin,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.863#aloud, pointing to a table where there were four or five bunches of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.864#flowers, which he had procured from the pay-desk for personal presents.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.865#“Ah, no!” exclaimed Henriette, with a backward movement. “I don't wish
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.866#to take any part in the wedding.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.867#They understood each other, and separated, exchanging glances of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.868#intelligence. As Madame Desforges was looking for Madame Guibal, she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.869#set up an exclamation of surprise on seeing her with Madame Marty. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.870#latter, followed by her daughter Valentine, had been carried away for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.871#the last two hours, right through the place, by one of those fits of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.872#spending from which she always emerged tired and confused. She had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.873#roamed about the furniture department that a show of white lacquered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.874#suites of furniture had changed into a vast young girl's room, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.875#ribbon and neckerchief department forming white vellumy colonnades, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.876#mercery and lace department, with its white fringes which surrounded
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.877#ingenious trophies patiently composed of cards of buttons and packets
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.878#of needles, and the hosiery department, in which there was a great crush
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.879#this year to see an immense piece of decoration, the name “The Ladies'
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.880#Paradise” in letters three yards high, formed of white socks on a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.881#groundwork of red ones. But Madame Marty was especially excited by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.882#new departments; they could not open a new department without she must
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.883#inaugurate it, she was bound to plunge in and buy something. And she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.884#passed an hour at the millinery counter, installed in a new room on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.885#ground-floor, having the cupboards emptied, taking the bonnets off the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.886#stands which stood on two tables, trying all of them on herself and her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.887#daughter, white hats, white bonnets, and white turbans. Then she had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.888#gone down to the boot department, at the further end of a gallery on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.889#ground-floor, behind the cravat department, a counter opened that day,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.890#and which she had turned topsy turvy, seized with sickly desires in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.891#presence of the white silk slippers trimmed with swansdown, the white
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.892#satin boots and shoes with their high Louis XV. heels.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.893#“Oh! my dear,” she stammered, “you've no idea! They have a wonderful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.894#assortment of hoods. I've chosen one for myself and one for my daughter.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.895#And the boots, eh? Valentine.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.896#“It's marvellous!” added the young girl, with her womanly boldness.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.897#“There are some boots at twenty francs and a half which are delicious!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.898#A salesman was following them, dragging along the eternal chair, on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.899#which was already heaped a mountain of articles.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.900#“How is Monsieur Marty?” asked Madame Desforges.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.901#“Very well, I believe,” replied Madame Marty, bewildered by this brusque
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.902#question, which fell ill-naturedly amidst her fever for spending. “He's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.903#still confined, my uncle had to go and see him this morning.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.904#“Oh, look! isn't it lovely?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.905#The ladies, who had gone on a few steps, found themselves before the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.906#flowers and feathers department, installed in the central gallery,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.907#between the silk and glove departments. It appeared beneath the bright
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.908#light of the glass roof as an enormous florescence, a white sheaf, tall
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.909#and broad as an oak. The base was formed of single flowers, violets,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.910#lilies of the valley, hyacinths, daisies, all the delicate hues of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.911#garden. Then came bouquets, white roses, softened by a fleshy tint,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.912#great white pæonies, slightly shaded with carmine, white chrysanthemums,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.913#with narrow petals and starred with yellow. And the flowers still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.914#ascended, great mystical lilies, branches of apple blossom, bunches of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.915#lilac, a continual blossoming, surmounted, as high as the first storey,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.916#by ostrich feathers, white plumes, which were like the airy breath of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.917#this collection of white flowers. One whole corner was devoted to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.918#display of trimmings and orange-flower wreaths. There were also metallic
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.919#flowers, silver thistles and silver ears of com. Amidst the foliage and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.920#the petals, amidst all this muslin, silk, and velvet, where drops of gum
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.921#shone like dew, flew birds of Paradise for hats, purple Tangaras with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.922#black tails, and Septicolores with their changing rainbow-like plumage.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.923#“I'm going to buy a branch of apple-blossom,” resumed Madame Marty.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.924#“It's delicious, isn't it? And that little bird, do look, Valentine. I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.925#must take it!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.926#Madame Guibal began to feel tired of standing still in the eddy of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.927#crowd, and at last said: “Well, we'll leave you to make your purchases.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.928#We're going upstairs.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.929#“No, no, wait for me!” cried the other. “I'm going up too. There's the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.930#perfumery department, I must see that.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.931#This department, created the day before, was next door to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.932#reading-room. Madame Desforges, to avoid the crush on the stairs, spoke
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.933#of going up in the lift, but they had to abandon the idea, there was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.934#such a crowd waiting their turn. At last they arrived, passing before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.935#the public Refreshment bar, where the crowd was becoming so great that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.936#an inspector had to restrain the people's appetites by only allowing the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.937#gluttonous customers to enter in small groups. And the ladies already
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.938#began to smell the perfumery department, a penetrating odour which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.939#scented the whole gallery. There was quite a struggle over one article,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.940#The Paradise soap, a specialty of the house. In the show cases, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.941#on the crystal tablets of the shelves, were ranged pots of pomade and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.942#paste, boxes of powder and paint, boxes of toilet vinegar; whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.943#the fine brushes, combs, scissors, and smelling-bottles occupied a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.944#special place. The salesmen had managed to decorate the shelves with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.945#white porcelain pots and white glass bottles. But what delighted the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.946#customers above all was a silver fountain, a shepherdess seated in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.947#middle of a harvest of flowers, and from which flowed a continual stream
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.948#of violet water, which fell with a musical plash into the metal basin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.949#An exquisite odour was disseminated around, the ladies dipping their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.950#handkerchiefs in the scent as they passed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.951#“There,” said Madame Marty, when she had loaded herself with lotions,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.952#dentrifices, and cosmetics. “Now I've done, I'm at your service. Let's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.953#go and rejoin Madame de Boves.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.954#But on the landing of the great central staircase they were again
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.955#stopped by the Japanese department. This counter had grown wonderfully
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.956#since the day Mouret had amused himself by setting up, in the same
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.957#place, a little proposition table, covered with a lot of soiled
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.958#articles, without at all foreseeing its future success. Few departments
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.959#had had a more modest commencement, and now it overflowed with old
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.960#bronzes, old ivories, old lacquer work. He did fifteen hundred thousand
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.961#francs' worth of business a year in this department, ransacking the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.962#Far East, where his travellers pillaged the palaces and the temples.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.963#Besides, fresh departments were always springing up, they had tried two
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.964#in December, in order to fill up the empty spaces caused by the dead
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.965#winter season--a book department and a toy department, which would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.966#certainly grow also and sweep away certain shops in the neighbourhood.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.967#Four years had sufficed for the Japanese department to attract the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.968#entire artistic custom of Paris. This time Madame Desforges herself,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.969#notwithstanding the rancour which had made her swear not to buy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.970#anything, succumbed before some finely carved ivory.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.971#“Send it to my house,” said she rapidly, at a neighbouring pay-desk.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.972#“Ninety francs, is it not?” And, seeing Madame Marty and her daughter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.973#plunged in a lot of trashy porcelains, she resumed, as she carried
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.974#Madame Guibal off: “You will find us in the reading-room, I really must
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.975#sit down a little while.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.976#In the reading-room they were obliged to remain standing. All the chairs
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.977#were occupied, round the large table covered with newspapers. Great fat
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.978#fellows were reading and lolling about without even thinking of giving
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.979#up their seats to the ladies. A few women were writing, their faces on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.980#the paper, as if to conceal their letters under the flowers of their
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.981#hats. Madame de Boves was not there, and Henriette was getting very
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.982#impatient when she perceived De Vallagnosc, who was also looking for his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.983#wife and mother-in-law. He bowed, and said:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.984#“They must be in the lace department--impossible to drag them away. I'll
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.985#just see.” And he was gallant enough to procure them two chairs before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.986#going away.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.987#In the lace department the crush was increasing every minute. The great
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.988#show of white was there triumphing in its most delicate and dearest
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.989#whiteness. It was an acute temptation, a mad desire, which bewildered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.990#all the women. The department had been turned into a white temple,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.991#tulles and Maltese lace, falling from above, formed a white sky, one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.992#of those cloudy veils which pales the morning sun. Bound the columns
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.993#descended flounces of Malines and Valenciennes, white dancers' skirts,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.994#unfolding in a snowy shiver down to the ground. Then on all sides, on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.995#every counter, was a stream of white Spanish blonde as light as air,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.996#Brussels with its large flowers on a delicate mesh, hand-made point, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.997#Venice point with heavier designs, Alençon point, and Bruges of royal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.998#and almost religious richness. It seemed that the god of dress had there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.999#set up his white tabernacle.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1000#Madame de Boves, after wandering about for a long time before the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1001#counters with her daughter, and feeling a sensual desire to plunge her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1002#hands into the goods, had just decided to make Deloche show her some
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1003#Alençon point. At first he brought out some imitation; but she wished to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1004#see some real Alençon, and was not satisfied with the little pieces at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1005#three hundred francs the yard, insisting on having deep flounces at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1006#a thousand francs a yard, handkerchiefs and fans at seven and eight
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1007#hundred francs. The counter was soon covered with a fortune. In a corner
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1008#of the department Jouve, the inspector, who had not lost sight of Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1009#de Boves, notwithstanding the latter's apparent dawdling, stood there
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1010#amidst the crowd, with an indifferent air, but still keeping a sharp eye
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1011#on her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1012#“Have you any in hand-made point?” she asked; “show me some, please.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1013#The salesman, whom she had kept there for twenty minutes, dared
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1014#not resist, she appeared so aristocratic, with her imposing air and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1015#princess's voice. However, he hesitated, for the salesmen were cautioned
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1016#against heaping up these precious fabrics, and he had allowed himself to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1017#be robbed of ten yards of Malines the week before. But she troubled him,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1018#he yielded, and abandoned the Alençon point for a moment to take the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1019#lace asked for from a drawer.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1020#“Oh! look, mamma,” said Blanche, who was ransacking a box close by, full
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1021#of cheap Valenciennes, “we might take some of this for pillow-cases.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1022#Madame de Boves not replying, her daughter on turning round saw her with
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1023#her hands plunged amidst the lace, about to slip some Alençon up the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1024#sleeve of her mantle. She did not appear surprised, and moved forward
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1025#instinctively to conceal her mother, when Jouve suddenly stood before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1026#them. He leant over, and politely murmured in the countess's ear:
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1027#“Have the kindness to follow me, madame.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1028#She hesitated for a moment, shocked.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1029#“But what for, sir?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1030#“Have the kindness to follow me, madame,” repeated the inspector,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1031#without raising his voice.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1032#Her face was full of anguish, she threw a rapid glance around her. Then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1033#she resigned herself all at once, resumed her haughty look, and walked
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1034#by his side like a queen who deigns to accept the services of an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1035#aide-de-camp. Not one of the customers had observed the scene, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1036#Deloche, on returning to the counter, looked at her being walked off,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1037#his mouth wide open with astonishment What! this one as well! this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1038#noble-looking lady! Really it was time to have them all searched! And
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1039#Blanche, who was left free, followed her mother at a distance, lingering
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1040#amidst the sea of faces, livid, divided between the duty of not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1041#deserting her mother and the terror of being detained with her. She saw
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1042#her enter Bourdoncle's office, but she contented herself with waiting
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1043#near the door. Bourdoncle, whom Mouret had just got rid of, happened to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1044#be there. As a rule, he dealt with these sorts of robberies committed by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1045#persons of distinction. Jouve had long been watching this lady, and had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1046#informed him of it, so that he was not astonished when the inspector
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1047#briefly explained the matter to him; in fact, such extraordinary cases
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1048#passed through his hands that he declared the women capable of anything
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1049#once the rage for dress had seized them. As he was aware of Mouret's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1050#acquaintance with the thief, he treated her with the utmost politeness.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1051#“We excuse these moments of weakness, madame. But pray consider the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1052#consequences of such a thing. Suppose some one else had seen you slip
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1053#this lace----”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1054#But she interrupted him in great indignation. She a thief! Who did
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1055#he take her for? She was the Countess de Boves, her husband,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1056#Inspector-General of the Stud, was received at Court.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1057#“I know, I know, madame,” repeated Bourdoncle, quietly. “I have the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1058#honour of knowing you. In the first place, will you kindly give up the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1059#lace you have on you?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1060#She again protested, not allowing him to say another word, handsome in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1061#her violence, going as far as tears. Any one else but he would have been
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1062#shaken and feared some deplorable mistake, for she threatened to go to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1063#law to avenge herself for such an insult.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1064#“Take care, sir, my husband will certainly appeal to the Minister.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1065#“Come, you are not more reasonable than the others,” declared
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1066#Bourdoncle, losing patience. “We must search you.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1067#Still she did not yield, but said with her superb assurance, “Very good,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1068#search me. But I warn you, you are risking your house.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1069#Jouve went to fetch two saleswomen from the corset department. When
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1070#he returned, he informed Bourdoncle that the lady's daughter, left at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1071#liberty, had not quitted the doorway, and asked if she should also
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1072#be detained, although he had not seen her take anything. The manager,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1073#always correct, decided that she should not be brought in, for the sake
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1074#of morality, and in order not to force a mother to blush before her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1075#daughter. The two men retired into a neighbouring room, whilst the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1076#saleswomen searched the countess, even taking off her dress to search
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1077#her bosom and hips. Besides the twelve yards of Alençon point at a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1078#thousand francs the yard concealed in her sleeve, they found in her
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1079#bosom a handkerchief, a fan, and a cravat, making a total of about
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1080#fourteen thousand francs' worth of lace. She had been stealing like this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1081#for the last year, ravaged by a furious, irresistible passion for dress.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1082#These fits got worse, growing daily, sweeping away all the reasonings of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1083#prudence, and the enjoyment she felt in the indulgence of this passion
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1084#was all the more violent from the fact that she was risking before the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1085#eyes of a crowd her name, her pride, and her husband's high position.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1086#Now that the latter allowed her to empty his drawers, she stole although
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1087#she had her pockets full of money, she stole for the pleasure of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1088#stealing, as one loves for the pleasure of loving, goaded on by desire,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1089#urged on by the species of kleptomania that her unsatisfied luxurious
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1090#tastes had developed in her formerly at sight of the enormous and brutal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1091#temptation of the big shops.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1092#“It's a trap,” cried she, when Bourdoncle and Jouve came in. “This lace
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1093#has been placed on me, I swear before Heaven.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1094#She was now weeping tears of rage, and fell on a chair, suffocated in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1095#her dress. The partner sent away the saleswomen, and resumed, with his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1096#quiet air: “We are quite willing, madame, to hush up this painful
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1097#affair for the sake of your family. But you must first sign a paper thus
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1098#worded: 'I have stolen some lace from The Ladies' Paradise,' followed by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1099#the details of the lace, and the day of the month. Besides, I shall be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1100#happy to return you this document whenever you like to bring me a sum of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1101#two thousand francs for the poor.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1102#She got up again, and declared in a fresh outburst: “I'll never sign
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1103#that, I'd rather die.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1104#“You won't die, madame; but I warn you that I shall shortly send for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1105#police.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1106#Then followed a frightful scene. She insulted him, she stammered that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1107#it was cowardly for a man to torture a woman in that way. Her Juno-like
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1108#beauty, her tall majestic body was distorted by vulgar rage. Then she
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1109#tried to melt them, entreating them in the name of their mothers, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1110#spoke of dragging herself at their feet. And as they remained quite
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1111#unmoved, hardened by custom, she sat down all at once and began to write
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1112#with a trembling hand. The pen sputtered, the words: “I have stolen,”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1113# written madly, went almost through the thin paper, whilst she repeated
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1114#in a strangled voice: “There, sir, there. I yield to force.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1115#Bourdoncle took the paper, carefully folded it, and put it in a drawer,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1116#saying: “You see it's in company, for ladies, after talking of dying
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1117#rather than signing, generally forget to come and redeem their _billets
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1118#doux_. However, I hold it at your disposal. You'll be able to judge
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1119#whether it's worth two thousand francs.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1120#She was buttoning up her dress, and became as arrogant as ever, now that
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1121#she had paid. “I can go now?” asked she, in a sharp tone.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1122#Bourdoncle was already occupied with other business. On Jouve's report,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1123#he decided on Deloche's dismissal, as a stupid fellow, who was always
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1124#being robbed, never having any authority over the customers. Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1125#de Boves repeated her question, and as they dismissed her with an
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1126#affirmative nod, she enveloped both of them in a murderous look. In the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1127#flood of insulting words that she kept back, a melodramatic cry escaped
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1128#from her lips.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1129#“Wretches!” said she, banging the door after her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1130#Meanwhile Blanche had not gone far away from the office. Her ignorance
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1131#of what was going on inside, the passing backwards and forwards of Jouve
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1132#and the two saleswomen frightened her, she had visions of the police,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1133#the assize court, and the prison. But all at once she stopped short: De
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1134#Vallagnosc was before her, this husband of a month, with whom she still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1135#felt rather awkward; and he questioned her, astonished at her bewildered
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1136#appearance.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1137#“Where's your mother? Have you lost each other? Come, tell me, you make
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1138#me feel anxious.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1139#Nothing in the way of a colourable fiction presented itself to her,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1140#and in great distress she told him everything in a low voice: “Mamma,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1141#mamma--she has been stealing.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1142#“What! stealing?” At last he understood. His wife's bloated face, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1143#pale mask, ravaged by fear, terrified him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1144#“Some lace, like that, up her sleeve,” she continued stammering.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1145#“You saw her, then? You were looking on?” murmured he, chilled to feel
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1146#her a sort of accomplice.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1147#They had to stop talking, several persons were already turning round. An
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1148#hesitation full of anguish kept De Vallagnosc motionless for a moment.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1149#What was to be done? He was about to go into Bourdoncle's office, when
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1150#he perceived Mouret crossing the gallery. He told his wife to wait for
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1151#him, and seized his old friend's arm, informing him of the affair, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1152#broken sentences. The latter hastily took him into his office, where
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1153#he soon put him at rest as to the possible consequences. He assured him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1154#that he need not interfere, and explained in what way the affair would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1155#be arranged, without appearing at all excited about this robbery, as if
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1156#he had foreseen it long ago. But De Vallagnosc, when he no longer feared
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1157#an immediate arrest, did not accept the adventure with this admirable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1158#coolness. He had thrown himself into an arm-chair, and now that he could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1159#discuss the matter, began to lament his own unfortunate position. Was it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1160#possible that he had married into a family of thieves? A stupid marriage
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1161#that he had drifted into, just to please his father! Surprised at this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1162#childish violence, Mouret watched him weeping, thinking of his former
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1163#pessimist boasting. Had he not heard him announce scores of times the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1164#nothingness of life, in which evil alone had any attraction? And by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1165#way of a joke he amused himself for a minute or so, by preaching
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1166#indifference to his friend, in a friendly, bantering tone. But at this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1167#De Vallognosc got angry: he was quite unable to recover his compromised
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1168#philosophy, his middle-class education broke out in virtuously indignant
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1169#cries against his mother-in-law. As soon as trouble fell on him, at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1170#the least appearance of human suffering, at which he had always coldly
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1171#laughed, the boasted sceptic was beaten and bleeding. It was abominable,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1172#they were dragging the honour of his race into the mud, and the world
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1173#seemed to be coming to an end.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1174#“Come, calm yourself,” concluded Mouret, stricken with pity. “I won't
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1175#tell you that everything happens and nothing happens, because that does
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1176#not seem to comfort you just now. But I think you ought to go and offer
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1177#your arm to Madame de Boves, that would be wiser than causing a scandal.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1178#The deuce! you who professed such scorn before the universal rascality
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1179#of the present day!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1180#“Of course,” cried De Vallagnosc, innocently, “when it affects other
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1181#people!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1182#However, he got up, and followed his old school-fellow's advice.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1183#Both were returning to the gallery when Madame de Boves came out of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1184#Bourdoncle's office. She accepted her son-in-law's arm with a majestic
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1185#air, and as Mouret bowed to her with respectful gallantry, he heard
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1186#her saying: “They've apologised to me. Really, these mistakes are
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1187#abominable.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1188#Blanche rejoined them, and they were soon lost in the crowd. Then
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1189#Mouret, alone and pensive, crossed the shop once more. This scene, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1190#had changed his thoughts from the struggle going on within him, now
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1191#increased his fever, and decided him to make a supreme effort. A vague
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1192#connection arose in his mind: the robbery by this unfortunate woman,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1193#the last folly of the conquered customers, beaten at the feet of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1194#tempter, evoked the proud and avenging image of Denise, whose victorious
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1195#grip he could feel at his throat. He stopped at the top of the central
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1196#staircase, and gazed for a long time into the immense nave, where his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1197#nation of women were swarming.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1198#Six o'clock was about to strike, the daylight decreasing outside was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1199#gradually forsaking the covered galleries, already dark and waning
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1200#at the further end of the halls, invaded by long shadows. And in this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1201#daylight, barely extinct, was commenced the lighting of the electric
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1202#lamps, the globes of an opaque whiteness studding with bright moons
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1203#the distant depths of the departments. It was a white brightness of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1204#blinding fixity, extending like the reverberation of a discoloured star,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1205#killing the twilight Then, when all were lighted, there was a delighted
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1206#murmur in the crowd, the great show of white goods assumed a fairy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1207#splendour beneath this new illumination. It seemed that this colossal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1208#orgie of white was also burning, itself becoming a light. The song of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1209#the white seemed to soar upward in the inflamed whiteness of an aurora.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1210#A white glimmer gushed from the linen and calico department in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1211#Monsigny Gallery, like the first bright gleam which lights up the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1212#eastern sky; whilst along the Michodière Gallery, the mercery and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1213#the lace, the fancy-goods and the ribbon departments threw out the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1214#reflection of distant hills--the white flash of the mother-of-pearl
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1215#buttons, the silvered bronzes and the pearls. But the central nave
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1216#especially was filled with a blaze of white: the puffs of white muslin
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1217#round the columns, the white dimities and other stuffs draping the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1218#staircases, the white lace flying in the air, opened up a dreamy
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1219#firmament, the dazzling whiteness of a paradise, where was being
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1220#celebrated the marriage of the unknown queen. The tent of the silk hall
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1221#was like a giant alcove, with its white curtains, gauzes and tulles, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1222#dazzle of which protected the bride in her white nudity from the gaze
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1223#of the curious. There was now nothing but this blinding white light
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1224#in which all the whites blended, a multitude of stars twinkling in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1225#bright clear light.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1226#And Mouret continued to watch his nation of women, amidst this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1227#shimmering blaze. Their black shadows stood out vigorously on the pale
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1228#ground-work. Long eddies divided the crowd; the fever of this day's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1229#great sale swept past like a frenzy, rolling along the disordered sea
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1230#of heads. People were commencing to leave, the pillage of the stuffs had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1231#encumbered all the counters, the gold was chinking in the tills; whilst
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1232#the customers went away, their purses completely empty, and their heads
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1233#turned by the wealth of luxury amidst which they had been wandering all
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1234#day. It was he who possessed them thus, keeping them at his mercy by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1235#his continued display of novelties, his reduction of prices, and his
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1236#“returns,” his gallantry and his advertisements. He had conquered the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1237#mothers themselves, reigning over them with the brutality of a despot,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1238#whose caprices were ruining many a household. His creation was a sort of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1239#new religion; the churches, gradually deserted by a wavering faith, were
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1240#replaced by this bazaar, in the minds of the idle women of Paris.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1241#Women now came and spent their leisure time in his establishment,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1242#the shivering and anxious hours they formerly passed in churches: a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1243#necessary consumption of nervous passion, a growing struggle of the god
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1244#of dress against the husband, the incessantly renewed religion of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1245#body with the divine future of beauty. If he had closed his doors,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1246#there would have been a rising in the street, the despairing cry of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1247#worshippers deprived of their confessional and altar. In their still
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1248#growing luxury, he saw them, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1249#obstinately clinging to the enormous iron building, along the suspended
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1250#staircases and flying bridges. Madame Marty and her daughter, carried
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1251#away to the highest point, were wandering amongst the furniture.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1252#Retained by her young people, Madame Bourdelais could not get away from
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1253#the fancy goods. Then came another group, Madame de Boves, still on De
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1254#Vallagnosc's arm, and followed by Blanche, stopping in each department,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1255#still daring to examine the articles with her superb air. But amidst the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1256#crowded sea of customers, this sea of bodies swelling with life, beating
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1257#with desire, all decorated with bunches of violets, as though for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1258#bridals of some sovereign, Mouret could now distinguish nothing but the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1259#bare bust of Madame Desforges, who had stopped in the glove department
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1260#with Madame Guibal. Notwithstanding her jealous rancour, she was also
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1261#buying, and he felt himself to be the master once more, having them
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1262#at his feet, beneath the dazzle of the electric light, like a drove of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1263#cattle from whom he had drawn his fortune.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1264#With a mechanical step, Mouret went along the galleries, so absorbed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1265#that he abandoned himself to the pushing of the crowd. When he raised
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1266#his head, he found himself in the new millinery department, the windows
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1267#of which looked on to the Rue du Dix-Décembre. And there, his forehead
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1268#against the glass, he made another halt, watching the departure of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1269#crowd. The setting sun was yellowing the roofs of the white houses, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1270#blue sky was growing paler, refreshed by a pure breath; whilst in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1271#twilight, which was already enveloping the streets, the electric lamps
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1272#of The Ladies' Paradise threw out that fixed glimmer of stars lighted on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1273#the horizon at the decline of the day. Towards the Opera-house and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1274#Bourse were the rows of waiting carriages, the harness still retaining
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1275#the reflections of the bright light, the gleam of a lamp, the glitter
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1276#of a silvered bit Every minute the cry of a footman was heard, and a cab
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1277#drew near, or a brougham issued from the ranks, took up a customer, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1278#went off at a rapid trot. The rows of carriages were now diminishing,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1279#six went off at a time, occupying the whole street, from the one side to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1280#the other, amidst the banging of doors, snapping of whips, and the hum
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1281#of the passers-by, who swarmed between the wheels. There was a sort of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1282#continual enlargement, a spreading of the customers, carried off to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1283#four corners of the city, emptying the building with the roaring clamour
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1284#of a sluice. And the roof of The Ladies' Paradise, the big golden
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1285#letters of the ensigns, the banners fluttering in the sky, still flamed
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1286#forth with the reflections of the setting sun, so colossal in this
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1287#oblique light, that they evoked the monster of advertising, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1288#phalansterium whose wings, incessantly multiplied, were swallowing up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1289#the whole neighbourhood, as far as the distant woods of the suburbs.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1290#And the soul of Paris, an enormous, sweet breath, fell asleep in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1291#serenity of the evening, running in long and sweet caresses over the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1292#last carriages, spinning through the streets now becoming deserted by
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1293#the crowd, disappearing into the darkness of the night.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1294#Mouret, gazing about, had just felt something grand in himself; and,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1295#in the shiver of triumph with which his flesh trembled, in the face of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1296#Paris devoured and woman conquered, he experienced a sudden weakness, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1297#defection of his strong will which overthrew him in his turn, beneath a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1298#superior force It was an unreasonable necessity to be vanquished in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1299#his victory, the nonsense of a warrior bending beneath the caprice of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1300#child, on the morrow of his conquests. He who had struggled for months,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1301#who even that morning had sworn to stifle his passion, yielded all at
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1302#once, seized by the vertigo of high places, happy to commit what he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1303#looked upon as a folly. His decision, so rapid, had assumed all at once
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1304#such energy that he saw nothing but her as being useful and necessary in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1305#the world.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1306#The evening, after the last dinner, he was waiting in his office,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1307#trembling like a young man about to stake his life's happiness, unable
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1308#to keep still, incessantly going towards the door to listen to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1309#rumours in the shop, where the men were doing the folding, drowned up
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1310#to the shoulder in a sea of stuffs. At each footstep his heart beat.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1311#He felt a violent emotion, he rushed forward, for he had heard in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1312#distance a deep murmur, which had gradually increased.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1313#It was Lhomme slowly approaching with the day's receipts. That day they
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1314#were so heavy, there was such a quantity of silver and copper, that he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1315#had been obliged to enlist the services of two messengers. Behind him
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1316#came Joseph and one of his colleagues, bending beneath the weight of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1317#the bags, enormous bags, thrown on their shoulders like sacks of wheat,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1318#whilst he walked on in front with the notes and gold, a note-book
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1319#swollen with paper, and two bags hung round his neck, the weight of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1320#which swayed him to the right, the same side as his broken arm. Slowly,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1321#perspiring and puffing, he had come from the other end of the shop,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1322#amidst the growing emotion of the salesmen. The employees in the glove
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1323#and silk departments laughingly offered to relieve him of his burden,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1324#the fellows in the drapery and woollen departments were longing to see
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1325#him make a false step, which would have scattered the gold through the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1326#place. Then he had been obliged to mount the stairs, go across a bridge,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1327#going still higher, turning about, amidst the longing looks of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1328#employees in the linen, the hosiery, and the mercery departments, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1329#followed him, gazing with ecstasy at this fortune travelling in the air.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1330#On the first-floor the employees in the ready-made, the perfumery, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1331#lace, and the shawl departments were ranged with devotion, as on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1332#passage of a king. From counter to counter a tumult arose, like the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1333#clamour of a nation bowing down before the golden calf.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1334#Mouret opened the door, and Lhomme appeared, followed by the two
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1335#messengers, who were staggering; and, out of breath, he still had
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1336#strength to cry out: “One million two hundred and forty-seven francs,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1337#nineteen sous!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1338#At last the million had been attained, the million picked up in a day,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1339#and of which Mouret had so long dreamed. But he gave way to an angry
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1340#gesture, and said impatiently, with the disappointed air of a man
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1341#disturbed by some troublesome fellow: “A million! very good, put it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1342#there.” Lhomme knew that he was fond of seeing the heavy receipts on
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1343#his table before they were taken to the central cashier's office. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1344#million covered the whole table, crushing the papers, almost overturning
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1345#the ink, running out of the sacks, bursting the leather bags, making a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1346#great heap, the heap of the gross receipts, such as it had come from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1347#customers' hands, still warm and living.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1348#Just as the cashier was going away, heart-broken at the governor's
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1349#indifference, Bourdoncle arrived, gaily exclaiming: “Ah! we've done it
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1350#this time. We've hooked the million, eh?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1351#But observing Mouret's febrile pre-occupation, he understood at once
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1352#and calmed down. His face was beaming with joy. After a short silence
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1353#he resumed: “You've made up your mind, haven't you? Well, I approve your
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1354#decision.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1355#Suddenly Mouret planted himself before him, and with his terrible voice
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1356#he thundered: “I say, my man, you're rather too lively. You think me
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1357#played out, don't you? and you feel hungry. But be careful, I'm not one
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1358#to be swallowed up, you know!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1359#Discountenanced by the sharp attack of this wonderful fellow, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1360#guessed everything, Bourdoncle stammered: “What now? Are you joking? I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1361#who have always admired you so!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1362#“Don't tell lies!” replied Mouret, more violently than ever “Just
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1363#listen, we were stupid to entertain the superstition that marriage would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1364#ruin us. Is it not the necessary health, the very strength and order of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1365#life? Well, my dear fellow, I'm going to marry her, and I'll pitch you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1366#all out at the slightest movement. Yes, you'll go and be paid like the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1367#rest, Bourdoncle.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1368#And with a gesture he dismissed him. Bourdoncle felt himself condemned,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1369#swept away, by this victory gained by woman. He went off. Denise was
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1370#just going in, and he bowed with a profound respect, his head swimming..
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1371#“Ah! you've come at last!” said Mouret gently.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1372#Denise was pale with emotion. She had just experienced another grief,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1373#Deloche had informed her of his dismissal, and as she tried to retain
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1374#him, offering to speak in his favour, he obstinately declined to
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1375#struggle against his bad luck, he wanted to disappear, what was the use
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1376#of staying? Why should he interfere with people who were happy? Denise
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1377#had bade him a sisterly adieu, her eyes full of tears. Did she not
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1378#herself long to sink into oblivion? Everything was now about to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1379#finished, and she asked nothing more of her exhausted strength than the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1380#courage to support this separation. In a few minutes, if she could only
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1381#be valiant enough to crush her heart, she could go away alone, to weep
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1382#unseen.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1383#“You wished to see me, sir,” she said in her calm voice. “In fact, I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1384#intended to come and thank you for all your kindness to me.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1385#On entering, she had perceived the million on the desk, and the display
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1386#of this money wounded her. Above her, as if watching the scene, was the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1387#portrait of Madame Hédouin, in its gilded frame, and with the eternal
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1388#smile of its painted lips.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1389#“You are still resolved to leave us?” asked Mouret, in a trembling
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1390#voice.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1391#“Yes, sir. I must!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1392#Then he took her hands, and said, in an explosion of tenderness, after
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1393#the long period of coldness he had imposed on himself: “And if I married
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1394#you, Denise, would you still leave?” But she had drawn her hands away,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1395#struggling as if under the influence of a great grief. “Oh! Monsieur
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1396#Mouret. Pray say no more. Don't cause me such pain again! I cannot!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1397#I cannot! Heaven is my witness that I was going away to avoid such a
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1398#misfortune!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1399#She continued to defend herself in broken sentences. Had she not already
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1400#suffered too much from the gossip of the house? Did he wish her to pass
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1401#in his eyes and her own for a worthless woman? No, no, she would
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1402#be strong, she would certainly prevent him doing such a thing. He,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1403#tortured, listened to her, repeating in a passionate tone: “I wish it. I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1404#wish it!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1405#“No, it's impossible. And my brothers? I have sworn not to marry. I
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1406#cannot bring you those children, can I?”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1407#“They shall be my brothers, too. Say yes, Denise.”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1408#“No, no, leave me. You are torturing me!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1409#Little by little he gave way, this last obstacle drove him mad. What!
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1410#She still refused even at this price! In the distance he heard the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1411#clamour of his three thousand employees building up his immense fortune.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1412#And that stupid million lying there! He suffered from it as a sort of
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1413#irony, he could have thrown it into the street.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1414#“Go, then!” he cried, in a flood of tears. “Go and join the man you
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1415#love. That's the reason, isn't it? You warned me, I ought to have known
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1416#it, and not tormented you any further.” She stood there dazed before
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1417#the violence of this despair. Her heart was bursting. Then, with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1418#impetuosity of a child, she threw herself on his neck, sobbing also, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1419#stammered: “Oh! Monsieur Mouret, it's you that I love!”
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1420#A last murmur was rising from The Ladies' Paradise, the distant
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1421#acclamation of a crowd. Madame Hédouin's portrait was still smiling,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1422#with its painted lips; Mouret had fallen on his desk, on the million
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1423#that he could no longer see. He did not quit Denise, but clasped her in
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1424#a desperate embrace, telling her that she could now go, that she could
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1425#spend a month at Valognes, which would silence everybody, and that he
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1426#would then go and fetch her himself, and bring her back, all-powerful,
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1427#and his wedded wife.
urn:cts:fuTexts:zola.paradise.novoa:xiv.1428#THE END.
